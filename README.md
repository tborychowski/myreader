**Update (2014-08-26):** Project has been discontinued because I finally found a free and perfect for all my needs rss aggregator and google reader alternative: [inoreader](http://www.inoreader.com)

**Update (2015-02-26):** It seems that my alternative is going adware. This project might yet be revived...

**Update (2015-10-07):** The alternative seems good and cheap enough for my needs. Due to the lack of free time this is now discontinued.

### Alternatives
- [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org) - extremely powerful, but huge and slow
- [Selfoss](http://selfoss.aditu.de) - pretty powerful, but still a bit too large and too slow (at least for me)
