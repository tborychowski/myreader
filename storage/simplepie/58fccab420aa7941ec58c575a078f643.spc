Take a wild guess how many.</p>
<p>The cicada onslaught grows nigh. Already the sex-crazed insects have begun burrowing their tiny bodies from out the depths of America's southern soils, where ground temperatures have already reached a steady 64 degrees. But soon, the cicadas' northerly relatives will reach the end of their 17-year dormancy and emerge in full force – and in numbers you won't believe.</p>
<p>A conservative – we repeat: <em>conservative – </em>estimate touted by several experts puts the ratio of cicadas to humans in the region of North Carolina to Connecticut at 600 to 1. That's <strong>30 billion cicadas</strong> to the area's 50.6-million people. It is also (we repeat a third time) the lower estimate. According to the Associated Press:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This year's invasion, Brood II, is one of the bigger ones. Several experts say that they really don't have a handle on how many cicadas are lurking underground but that 30 billion seems like a good estimate. At the Smithsonian Institution, researcher Gary Hevel thinks it may be more like 1 trillion.</p>
<p>Even if it's merely 30 billion, if they were lined up head to tail, they'd reach the moon and back.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be some places where it's wall-to-wall cicadas,&quot; says University of Maryland entomologist Mike Raupp.</p>

<p><strong>WALL TO WALL CICADAS. </strong>Remember everybody: keep your mouths closed in the days ahead.</p>

TNT has officially greenlit this show about a single Navy vessel after the end of the world, airing in 2014.</p>
<p><em>The Last Ship</em> was originally a <a data-amazontag="io9amzn-20" data-amazonasin="0345359828" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Ship-William-Brinkley/dp/0345359828?tag=io9amzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|494240859">novel by William Brinkley</a> about a single vessel surviving after a nuclear apocalypse — but <a href="http://io9.com/5950314/how-cheesy-will-michael-bays-post+apocalyptic-show-the-last-ship-be">io9 was the first site to report</a><inset id="5950314"></inset> that Michael Bay's version was ditching pretty much the entire premise of the book, and replacing it with a &quot;deadly virus apocalypse&quot; storyline instead. Now, you can see for yourself — and just how much do you think Adam Baldwin is going to run away with this puppy? (Along with Rhona Mitra as an icy scientist?) </p>
<p>Here's what TNT wants you to know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TNT has greenlit the action-packed drama series The Last Ship, starring Eric Dane (Grey's Anatomy) and executive-produced by blockbuster filmmaker Michael Bay (Transformers). Based on William Brinkley's popular novel, The Last Ship comes to TNT from Bay's Platinum Dunes and its partners, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form, whose credits include upcomingTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Bay, Fuller and Form serve as executive producers, along with showrunner Hank Steinberg (Without a Trace) and Steven Kane (The Closer). Steinberg and Kane wrote the series pilot, which was directed by Jonathan Mostow (U-571).</p>

<p>TNT has ordered 10 episodes of The Last Ship, with plans to launch the series in 2014. The story opens with a global catastrophe that nearly decimates the world's population. Because of its positioning, the Navy destroyer U.S.S. Nathan James avoids falling victim to the devastating tragedy. But now the crew and its captain must confront the reality of their new existence in a world where they may be among the few remaining survivors.</p>

<p>Dane stars as Captain Tom Chandler, a career Navy man who is authoritative and decisive, but also fair and courageous. A born leader and a loving father and husband, Chandler is respected and loved by the men and women under his command. The Last Ship also stars Rhona Mitra (Strike Back) as Rachel Scott, a strong-willed, intelligent and fearless paleomicrobiologist assigned to the Nathan James to investigate the cause of billions of deaths worldwide. Adam Baldwin (Firefly, Chuck) is Slattery, the ship's second-in-command who worries deeply about his family and occasionally clashes with Dane's Captain Chandler over the best course of action. And Tracy Middendorf (Boardwalk Empire, Mission: Impossible III) plays Darien Chandler, the captain's wife.</p>

<p>&quot;The Last Ship has all the elements of a big Hollywood blockbuster, from its epic storytelling to its top-notch cast headed by the perfect leading man, Eric Dane,&quot; said Michael Wright, president, head of programming for TNT, TBS and Turner Classic Movies (TCM). &quot;Michael Bay and his fellow executive producers have shaped William Brinkley's story and characters into an exceptional drama full of action, suspense, tragedy and triumph. The Last Ship is smart, fun television that takes you on a great ride.&quot;</p>

And as it turns out, the super-luxe buildings of <em>Elsyium</em>'s tomorrow actually exist right here in the present day. </p>
<p>The movie, which comes out in August, is a barely veiled critique of the current divide between rich and poor.

It has not been easy.</p>
<p>Trivers first began to suspect that something was amiss in 2007, two years after the study – which found Jamaican teens with a high degree of body symmetry were <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7071/full/nature04344.html" target="_blank">more likely to be rated &quot;good dancers&quot; by their peers</a> – had been featured on the cover of <em>Nature</em>. As Nature News' Eugenie Samuel Reich reports, Trivers has been fighting since 2008 to have the results withdrawn from the scientific literature, at the occasional expense of his reputation: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In seeking a retraction, Trivers self-published <em>The Anatomy of a Fraud</em>, a small book detailing what he saw as evidence of data fabrication. Later, Trivers had a verbal altercation over the matter with a close colleague and was temporarily banned from campus.</p>
<p>An investigation of the case, completed by Rutgers and released publicly last month, now seems to validate Trivers’ allegations. Brown disputes the university’s finding, but it could help to clear the controversy that has clouded Trivers’ reputation as the author of several pioneering papers in the 1970s. For example, Trivers advanced an influential theory of ‘reciprocal altruism’, in which people behave unselfishly and hope that they will later be rewarded for their good deeds. He also analysed human sexuality in terms of the investments that mothers and fathers each make in child-rearing.</p>
<p>Steven Pinker, a psychologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, calls the dancing paper “a lark” and “journalist bait” that lacks a firm basis in theory. “It was cute rather than deep,” he says. But he describes Trivers’ earlier work as “monumental”, and says that it would be a travesty if Trivers became known for one controversial study rather than his wider contributions to evolutionary biology. “Trivers is one of the most important thinkers in the history of the biological and social sciences,” Pinker says.</p>

<p>Sometimes <a href="http://io9.com/5855733/psychologist-admits-to-faking-dozens-of-scientific-studies">scientists lie</a><inset id="5855733"></inset>. When they do, it is often up to other scientists to call them on their bullshit. In this case, it has taken close to five years for &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence of fabrication by Brown to come to light (Brown continues to deny fabricating the data). Today, Samuel Reich reports,that &quot;the [National Science Foundation's] inspector-general... is reviewing it to determine what action, if any, to take.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Traditional<br/>Maria Dahvana Headley</strong></p>
<p><strong>I.</strong></p>
<p>By your first anniversary, the world’s stopped making paper, and so you can’t give your boyfriend the traditional gift. You never would have anyway, regardless of circumstances. You’re not that kind of girl. You pride yourself on your original sin. It’s the hot you trade in.</p>
<p>So you give him the piece of your skin just beneath your ribcage on the right side, where the floating ribs bend in. It’s a good part. Not the best. You’re like a food hoarder who pretends her larder’s empty, all the while running her finger along the dusty ledge that leads to the trick shelves that hold the jars of Caspian caviar. You’ve always been the kind of liar who leans back and lets boys fall into you while you see if you can make them fall all the way out the other side. You want them to feel like they’ve hit Narnia. You traffic in interdimensional fucking, during which they transcend space and time, and you go nowhere. When they fall in love, you Shun &amp; Break™ them. Their poor plastic hearts are Pez dispensers topped with copyright violation Mickey Mice.</p>
<p>Your boy’s not falling for this shit. He simply refuses. He sees through your methods. You met him in a bar on the night of the first apocalypse, just prior, and both of you somehow lived through the night.</p>
<p>He clocked you from moment one, when you bought him a drink and brought it to him, fresh lipstick on your mouth, altering your walk to cause him pain. He drank it. He then took the cherry out of yours and drank your drink too, looking at you the whole time like he was a prime transgressor who was going to rock your world until it broke.</p>
<p>“You gonna try to make me love you now?” he asked. “That your thing?”</p>
<p>“Brother,” you said, taken aback by the way he’d just needlessly whacked the rules of flirtation, “I don’t even know you exist.”</p>
<p>This would have been the end of it, except that five minutes later there was a rending, and everyone was screaming and trying to get away, and buildings were falling down, and the streets were full of unimaginable.</p>
<p>You were out of your element. You loved the Woolworthing of the world before the apocalypse, the shopping mall fluorescence of flirtation, the IKEA particleboard pushing together of things that would shortly fall apart. You loved paper parasols and plastic monkeys. Everything was your toy. You killed men, but they never got anywhere near killing you.</p>
<p>But he grabbed your hand, and you grabbed his, and you took off running together, dodging crazy, jumping holes in the streets, not stopping to look at the people who were down on the ground already, vomiting up important parts of anatomy.</p>
<p>You didn’t actually see the worms that night, though other people did. That was the first anyone heard of them.</p>
<p>When you finally got indoors and safe as you were likely to get given the stakes, given the world situation—sex, you informed him, was necessary, because minus sex? This shit was just monsters and the end of the world.</p>
<p>He wasn’t so sure. He’d sobered up, considered lighting out on his own, but you insisted you were better off together. Then you tore off his clothes and climbed him like a firefighter reversing up a pole.</p>
<p>Maybe you love him now, maybe you don’t. You don’t trust him, but there’s nothing new about that.</p>
<p>The apartment you share has big windows, and no curtains. You don’t look out. The floor beneath the window has an old bloodstain, but whatever happened there happened a long time ago. In bed, you’re rubber and he’s glue, and it’s hot enough to keep you going.</p>
<p>“This is so you can write on me instead of paper,” you say, thrilling at your own <em>fin de monde</em> generosity. The rest of the world’s in mourning, but you’re celebrating your survival.</p>
<p>You roll over to face him. You’ve outlined the page with a razor blade. The rest of you is unmarked. There’s the promise of a quarto. Back before all this, you were both, weirdly, the kind of people who footnoted fucks. You prided yourselves on your grasp of gory details of the philosophical arguments of the 1300s. Now you don’t know what you are. Your dissertation is stalled. You used to be the cool girl. Now you’re just a live girl.</p>
<p>Your boy presses his cheek to your hipbone.</p>
<p>“You feel like a fossil,” he says. “Like a pterodactyl wrapped in fabric.”</p>
<p>“As long as I don’t feel like a worm,” you say.</p>
<p>You know very well that you don’t. The people out there who’ve died, the ones eaten by the worms? First everything liquefies. Then the worm emerges. While it’s happening, you feel it like an earthquake inside your soul. There’s a reason you’re in here. A year of that, and the worms are getting bigger all the time. They start out the size of pencils.</p>
<p>He cuts a word into your skin, and then another, and you gasp when the knife touches you, because here’s something you’ve never done before, and you’re a girl who does everything. You have a flash of worry about yourself. There is a distinct possibility that you’re flipping backward, your head upturned, everything sweet you’ve kept hidden sliding out into his hands.</p>
<p>Outside you can hear one of the worms moving through the streets, a big one, about the size of a motorcycle. You blow out the candle. It’s not like you’re scared.</p>
<p>“Do you remember mimeograph machines?” you ask him. You do. Your grade school had one. Once, because you couldn’t stop talking, you were exorcised in the mimeograph room by a substitute teacher using Diet Sprite as holy water. Back then, you couldn’t stop anything once you started. You revolved like a bent top, twitched, and bit boys. You cast spells. None of them worked. Now, if you were out there, it would be worse than mimeograph ink. People believe in things they didn’t.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I remember mimeographs,” he says, and smiles. “The purple ink. It smelled like a hot skillet.”</p>
<p>You flip over so you don’t have to look at him, and then you roll across the sheet to print the words he’s written, grabbing the fuck out of random religion, but isn’t everyone?</p>
<p><em>Hallelujah, Holy, Glory, Be, God, Gone, Gotten,</em> <em>Begat, Bore, Bear,</em> <em>Beginning: in the</em>. <em>End of days.</em></p>
<p>Out in the street there is a scream, high and wavering, which you both totally ignore.</p>
<p><strong>II.</strong></p>
<p>For your second anniversary, he gives you two teeth, wisdom. The traditional gift is cotton, but you’ve sold most of your clothes. He gives you ivory instead. The teeth aren’t quite white, because of the drinking of tea, back before it all. They’ve been out of his mouth for a while. The world’s shifted away from dentistry, or rather, the world’s shifted from cosmetic dentistry into tooth-retention, but his were removed before all that. He’s lost other things, too. He has no appendix. He has no tonsils. He still owns both his kidneys, though. You only have one.</p>
<p>The thought that he purposefully had organs removed, and didn’t even sell them, makes you pissed off with the waste (<em>wastrel</em>, you compulsively think, over and over, <em>wastrel wastrel</em>) and so you carefully don’t imagine his tonsils twitching on a tonsil heap. His appendix like a tiny harp, strumming inside a bath of alcohol.</p>
<p>There is, by now, a black market trade in vestigials, and the wisdom teeth are worth their weight in something. Some people have their mouths studded with other people’s teeth. It’s become a status symbol. The worms, however, don’t care. People are entirely in hiding by now, and still, sometimes, a worm gets in. No one sleeps with an open mouth anymore. There are masks and door seals. If you see a worm, even a tiny one, you’re supposed to shine a light on it and stomp on its head. This is not always possible. It takes time, but eventually, the worms get their way.</p>
<p>“Do you love me?” you ask him. It’s bullshit to hear yourself. Your voice sounds wobbly. You sound like what you never were.</p>
<p>“I gave you my teeth,” he says, but he doesn’t say he loves you. You are now plastic in a world where no one needs anything but metal.</p>
<p>You don’t say you love him, either. You met during an apocalypse. What kind of fool are you?</p>
<p>“What are your teeth for?” you ask.</p>
<p>“To pay tolls,” he says and then he closes your fingers around them. You hide the teeth beneath your pillow. One morning there are coins in their place. Some old traditions, apparently, linger in the world. Or maybe you did that, to try to make him love you. You place the coins on his eyes as he sleeps, and he wakes up laughing.</p>
<p>“Not that kind of toll,” he says.</p>
<p>You aren’t laughing. You hide his teeth, in case they’re ever all that is left of him, and you have to find something to bury. You curse yourself. Even at the end of the world, you’re still trying to rig the system. You don’t want to talk about love, and so you talk about worms. You casually relate anecdotes of people who died, listing their agonies like ingredients in a complicated recipe, waiting for him to tell you he loves you, waiting for him to tell you he hopes the worms don’t get you.</p>
<p><strong>III.</strong></p>
<p>Your skin, by the third year, for which the traditional gift is leather, is covered with words no one uses any longer. He’s careful. You’re careful. The blood isn’t much.</p>
<p>Sometimes he quotes you. “Brother, I don’t even know you exist.” Then sometimes he laughs. Sometimes he doesn’t.</p>
<p>Sometimes you tell him everything you know about him, which is everything except one thing.</p>
<p>Other things have gone wrong outside. You’re living in a drifting cloud of ash from some far off worm-battling explosion, and the lights are out, and the sun’s dimmed. You eat from cans opened with stabbing, and you aren’t sure what you’re eating, but no one says anything nasty. You’re still together, in a new little room, this one with only three walls. Your old apartment sank into a hole in the Earth and was gone for good. He traces words on your skin, and then erases them, and then traces new ones over the scars. You comfort each other with childhood.</p>
<p>“Blackboard,” he says, grinning in the dim. “Do you remember?”</p>
<p>“Eraser monitor,” you reply. “More times than I should have been.”</p>
<p>“Chalk dust,” he says. “Inhaled.”</p>
<p>“Snow,” you say. “Back when there was snow.”</p>
<p>“There’s still snow somewhere,” he says.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” you say. “No ice. Remember ice?”</p>
<p>“Of course I remember ice,” he says, annoyed, because he’s started to forget it. “Your drink had ice the night we met.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t any ice left,” you say, your voice taut against his cheek, and what you mean is, <em>I’m a new world, fall into me. </em>You’re scared of being by yourself at the end of the world, even though you pretend you’re chill.<em> Chill</em>, you repeat to yourself, <em>chill chill chill</em>. It starts to sound like a word you don’t know.</p>
<p>“How would you know?” he asks.</p>
<p>In the dark, you hand him the scar from your inner thigh. In the space where it was, there’s now another scar. You’ve stitched the leather into a purse, on which you’ve scarred an unsayable word.</p>
<p>“Tetragrammaton,” he says, and you feel him tasting the sound of it, not unimpressed with your syllables.</p>
<p>The end of the world has not made you a believer. The end of the word has.</p>
<p><strong>IV.</strong></p>
<p>By the fourth anniversary, you’ve forgotten the traditional gifts. Sex has begun to involve your skeletons. Your boy gives you his scalp. There’s a girl one apartment over who was a surgeon, and she comes in with a flat cloth-wrapped packet of knives and little saws like chefs used to carry. She cuts a circle out of his scalp, then out of his skull. You touch his brain, just once, with your fingertip, watching his eyes roll beneath closed lids. Then the doctor replaces the circles and closes his head back up with black stitches so no worms get in.</p>
<p>You give him your heart. Once your chest cavity is open, he looks at it beating for thirteen seconds, and then the doctor closes you back up again. It takes months to heal from that anniversary, but when you finally do, though you no longer have a bed, you lie on the floor and hold hands, and he tells you what your heart looks like at close range. You tell him about the gray whorls of his brain.</p>
<p>“I pretty much love you,” you say at last.</p>
<p>“I pretty much loved you the whole time,” he says. “Since I saw you standing on top of the bar as the roof fell in. Since I saw you kill that worm with a bottle of bourbon.”</p>
<p>This is a new kind of love for both of you, but not a new kind of love for the world. In the pre-catastrophe world, things that loved one another sometimes ate their mates. You both consider this. The thought of lapping at blood and chewing flesh becomes tempting. You’re both getting mad scared of the dark.</p>
<p><strong>V.</strong></p>
<p>For your fifth anniversary, after the sun is apparently gone for good, you’re fully baroque. You cut off your hair and sell it to buy a ring for him. There’s still a trade in hair. It’s used to weave blankets. It’s also used in spells. Magic has started to exist again, in the desperate early mornings.</p>
<p>He’s had the bones of his fingers made into a comb for your hair, which is, of course, gone. There’s a man who does that, filing the bones down into something spined and wired. The story that inspired these gifts is a cheesy classic, one you both partially remember from childhood, and it’s become hot, too, though in its original version it was only about love and pocketwatches. Sex at the end of the world is a pornographic, ecstatic recitation of everything that has ever and has never existed, a naming of genus and species, taxonomies of winged creatures and those that slither.</p>
<p>“Lunchmeat,” he says.</p>
<p>“Tempeh,” you say.</p>
<p>“Hummingbirds,” he says.</p>
<p>“Doves,” you say.</p>
<p>“Suspender buttons.”</p>

<p>You pause in your movements, considering extinctions.</p>

<p>“My grandfather,” he replies.</p>
<p>“Blake.”</p>
<p>“Rima.”</p>
<p>“Geraldine.”</p>

<p>He puts his remaining hand up to touch your shaven head.</p>
<p>“There was a gorilla,” he says. “Do you remember it?”</p>
<p>“There was a gorilla who climbed the Empire State Building,” you finish. You aren’t who you were. You’ve given him all the things you were saving for yourself.</p>
<p>In the world outside your room, the question now is whether to go out and fight the newest version of the worm. This one rears up and bares its teeth. It’s got seven rows of sharp: old school multiplex shit. Now it emerges, in the shadowy days at the end of everything. No one has yet seen its tail. It seems to go on forever.</p>
<p>Outside your windows, buildings begin to crumble, and the sidewalks ripple. You are still that loser thinking about love.</p>
<p>“I have to go out,” you say.</p>
<p>“I have to go out, too,” he replies, and you touch him with your tongue. He tastes like you. Both of you are hungry. You feel like you might explode from out of his chest, or him from yours, writhing and opening jaws, eyeless.</p>
<p>Outside, the worm is rising where the sunrise was. Its flesh is smooth and gray. Your building shakes as the worm moves around it, wrapping it in coils.</p>
<p>“Nylon support stockings,” he says.</p>
<p>“Slinkies,” you counter.</p>
<p>“William Blake.”</p>
<p>“Loch Ness.”</p>
<p>A window breaks. He stands up. You stand up, too, and walk out without looking at him again. There’s nowhere to look, in any case. It’s dark. You start climbing.</p>
<p>The worm makes its way through the streets, turning left and turning right, making a low sound, a slurring rasp. It’s a successful worm. The more people a worm gets, the bigger it grows. You walk out under the sky, hunting the worm as the worm hunts you. You’re just a normal person who lived through things she shouldn’t have. Your fires have gone out. You’re not especially special.</p>
<p>Heaven is a cloud of ash, a starless place full of low nests.</p>
<p>You hold your present in your hand, the pronged, sharpened fingers of your man, and below you, you see the worm, shining in the no light.</p>
<p><em>Fall into me</em>, you think, using your old self, willing the worm to woo. It shouldn’t come to you, but it does. Hunger and love work the same way. The spells you knew as a little girl are still part of you. Once you start spelling you’re never stopping. It’s like you have an audience and a word with a million letters, and you’re going to spell it to death. It’s like you’re a champion.</p>
<p>The worm stretches itself and you stand on top of a building, watching it approach. It’s curious. No one comes out in the street anymore. It smells you, or tastes you in the air.</p>
<p>Then, movement. Now you know why the worm is coming. Your man is in the street, the purse made of your skin held out before him, and on your skin, the unsayable word.</p>
<p>The worm writhes toward him, following your scent, and you’re shaking, feeling a this-is-it-shithead situation, but you’re here anyway and so is he. You can see your ring, flashing on your man’s finger, his remaining hand outstretched. He throws the purse into the worm’s mouth, and it laps at it, tasting it, rasping. Its teeth are shining and white, whiter than anything you’ve seen before. They close on the purse like it’s a washrag being wrung. Now the worm’s eaten the name of god. In some places, that would be poison.</p>
<p>Its head turns toward you.</p>
<p>You teeter, teeter, and leap, an old movie move showing up in your game plan unexpectedly. You dive for its face, its open mouth, its seven rows of teeth, and they cut you as you go in. No mouth, only throat. The thing is <em>all </em>throat. You hold out the comb and claw your way down.</p>
<p>You’re going into the center of the Earth. You fall, and you fall, and all around you the stars are falling, too. The inside of the worm is the inside of the world. You claw words into its throat, and you’re covered in blood and wet, in cold dark. You’re being digested and pulsed, inside a long channel of charnel. You think about all the people this worm has eaten from the inside, and now you’re inside it, too. You’ll do the same. You’re Woolworthing the monster, cataloging it into a bin of like unnecessaries.</p>
<p>You’re fucking terrified.</p>
<p>You think about your mother, whom you haven’t seen in years. You think about your umbilical cord and the way it wormtangled around your throat. You think about how you lived through that. You hold your man’s hand, the sharpened points of the fingers, and around you, the worm convulses and quivers. You stab yourself in, using the bonecomb, finger by finger, and you tear at the worm’s simplicity, bisecting it like a bad deed on a summer afternoon.</p>
<p>Eventually there is a larger shudder, a scream, a rasp, and you feel the worm give way.</p>
<p><strong>VI.</strong></p>
<p>For your sixth anniversary, you are the woman who emerged unscathed from the worm that ate the city. He’s the man who did it with you. You hold his hand in yours, and his other hand, the one made of bone, holds your hair, grown back now, into a twist on top of your head. The sky changes. The ash drifts down. You’ve given way, just as the worm did, and now, your skin, covered in words, and his body, covered in scars, are what the remaining people know to be the way that leaders look.</p>
<p>Beneath the streets, the worms are asunder, rotting corpses, bewildered by bones.</p>
<p>You met him drinking. He met you drinking your drink. Now you’re both in charge of things.</p>
<p>You give him a look for your sixth anniversary. He gives you the same look back.</p>

Back in January, we called his captivating one-minute short <a href="http://io9.com/5973077/this-eerie-animation-was-hand+drawn-with-ink-coffee-and-white+out-and-it-will-melt-your-face">&quot;The Deep End&quot;</a><inset id="5973077"></inset> sixty of the most unsettling seconds we'd sat through in some time. His latest animation – titled <a href="http://vimeo.com/65535198" target="_blank">&quot;Raw Data&quot;</a> – confirms the Boston-based artist still has what it takes to hold us in disquiet thrall.</p>
<p>Like &quot;The Deep End,&quot; Fried's latest animation was hand-animated frame-by-frame by layering ink, coffee, white-out and gouache atop a single canvas. The scenes metamorphose pretty quickly from frame to frame, so this is definitely the kind of thing that rewards multiple viewings. Just make sure you do it in full screen, HD, with headphones (Fried's choice of music adds another layer to the whole experience), and try not to focus on the fact that the character in the animation appears to be staring back/over/through a computer screen of his very own... which... well... maybe don't watch this before you go to bed.</p>

His work on movies such as <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, <em>Jason And The Argonauts</em>, <em>The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad </em>will be remembered in the world of cinema forever (<a href="http://images.wikia.com/pixar/images/0/0c/Harryhausens.jpg" target="_blank">and even nodded to in current films</a> like <em>Monsters Inc.). </em></p>

The classic space opera has had its ups and downs over the years, but it's <a href="http://io9.com/5941608/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-star-trek-the-original-series">always turned death into a fighting chance for life</a><inset id="5941608"></inset>. Still, it's hard not to think about some of the amazing paths <em>Trek</em> could have taken. Here are 10 great missed opportunities from <a href="http://io9.com/5846344/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-star-trek-the-next-generation">Star Trek's history</a><inset id="5846344"></inset>.</p>
<p>To assemble this list, we did a ton of brainstorming and mind-melding — but we also talked to Anthony Pascale from the indispensible <a href="http://trekmovie.com/" target="_blank">TrekMovie.com</a> and Robert Meyer Burnett, CEO of the Ludovico Technique and <a href="http://io9.com/5928504/star-trek-the-next-generation-is-brand-new-all-over-again">producer</a><inset id="5928504"></inset> of the <a href="http://io9.com/5965278/that-new-blu+ray-set-might-actually-make-you-learn-to-love-star-trek-tng-season-2"><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation Blu-rays</em></a><inset id="5965278"></inset>, who gave us a ton of great ideas.</p>
<p>So here are 10 things that <em>Star Trek</em> missed out on, that could have been amazing:</p>

<h4>1) Not having Toshiro Mifune play a Klingon</h4>
<p>No clue whether <em>Star Trek: Planet of the Titans</em> would have been great or awful, but the thought of Toshiro Mifune as a Klingon is too exhilarating for words. <em>Titans</em> was the Star Trek movie they were trying to make in 1976-1977, and Philip Kaufman (<em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Right Stuff, Unbearable Lightness of Being</em>) was on board to direct. Kaufman, who also wrote one script draft, wanted to make something cerebral and a little trippy — this was the era between <em>2001</em> and <em>Star Wars</em>, after all — and he wanted the focus to be on Spock versus a Klingon, played by the <em>Rashomon</em> star. <a href="http://io9.com/5721854/ralph-mcquarries-lost-concept-art-for-a-star-trek-movie-in-1976+1977/">See <em>Planet of the Titans</em> concept art here</a><inset id="5721854"></inset>.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="269" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18myfbeuom5lzjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>2) Not going with the original plans for Star Trek III</h4>
<p>According to Burnett, the original story treatment for Star Trek III was more serious and thought-provoking — and wouldn't have screwed up the Klingons. Producer Harve Bennett's original treatment features Romulans instead of Klingons, who arrive with their cloaking Bird of Prey, to investigate the Genesis Planet, which has appeared out of nowhere. And because the planet is littered with Dilithium crystals, they set up a mining operation — until they start getting picked off, one by one, by a feral Spock, whose aging is tied to the planet's. Meanwhile, Vulcan is so horrified to discover that the Federation created such a terrible weapon as the Genesis Device, the Vulcans want to secede from the Federation. Kirk has to go to Vulcan, with the crew of the Enterprise, to face the angry Vulcans. Burnett feels like this would have been a more serious, &quot;perilous&quot; and above all epic story — and it would have featured a Romulan commander along the lines of the thoughtful antagonist from the original Romulan story, &quot;Balance of Terror.&quot; This would have been a much better film, and might have elevated the franchise to a new level — instead of the more pedestrian <em>Star Trek III</em>, which among other things redefines the Klingons as over-the-top cartoons, influencing their portrayal for years afterwards.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="274" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18myfochuwiahjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>3) Not having Eddie Murphy in Star Trek IV</h4>
<p>Back in the mid-1980s, Eddie Murphy was on top of the world, having just starred in <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em> — and he was very seriously in talks to play a major supporting role in <em>Star Trek IV</em>, the one where Kirk and his crew go back to present-day Earth to look for whales. This was when Eddie Murphy was at the top of his game, and he probably would have added a serious comedic spark to the funniest of the <em>Trek</em> films. This came pretty close to happening, and then fell through at the last minute — so Murphy could go off and do <em>The Golden Child</em> instead, says Pascale. Sigh.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="489" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18myfz765uqn5jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>4) Not replacing Will Riker with his transporter duplicate Tom Riker</h4>
<p>Remember that episode where Riker meets his transporter twin, who's still in love with Deanna Troi and is less of a swaggering smirkface? This was right around the time when Riker (and TNG in general) really needed a change — and they came very close to killing off Will Riker and replacing him permanently with Tom Riker. Data would have become first officer, and Tom Riker would have taken a less senior position on the bridge, because his rank was lower. This would have been a fascinating change, allowing the show to explore its cast's dynamics a whole new way — but without major cast changes or alterations too jarring for casual viewers to roll with. (And they needn't have killed off Will Riker — they could have finally given him a ship to command, which he was overdue for.) But in the end, they skipped this idea.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="269" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18myg21rsf7wujpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>5) Not giving us a proper Kirk/Picard team-up</h4>
<p><em>Star Trek: Generations</em> easily counts as one of the great missed opportunities in the series' history.  You already have William Shatner on board to be in your film, along with a few of the other <em>TOS </em>actors — why not make it a proper passing of the torch, and meeting of the captains, in their element? Why not build a story around the differences between the two Enterprise crews and captains? If they had only given us something as good as the <em>TNG</em> episode &quot;Relics,&quot; in which Scotty is rescued, <em>Generations</em> would have been a moving film. Not saying that we wanted fanservice, or a sop to those of us who wanted to see Picard battle Kirk — just that we deserved a good story, in which Kirk's return is an important, not incidental, part of the narrative. If you don't have any ideas for how to use Kirk properly, just don't include him at all.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="275" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18myg568js9dtjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>6) Not giving us the Captain Sulu TV show we all wanted</h4>
<p><br/> Pretty much from the moment Sulu got his own command in <em>Star Trek VI</em>, actor George Takei  and many of the fans were <a href="http://www.trektoday.com/content/2010/06/takei-backs-ift-in-voyages-interview/" target="_blank">clamoring</a>  for a <em>Captain Sulu</em> TV show. Maybe this was never a serious possibility — but dammit, a show about Sulu and the crew of the Excelsior could have been so good. With lots of crazy starship battles and exploration and a proper continuation of the 1980s film series.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="485" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18myge9rng3b5jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>7) Not having Tom Hanks in Star Trek: First Contact</h4>
<p>For a while, the <em>You've Got Mail</em> star was in talks to play the key role of Zefram Cochrane, inventor of the warp drive, in this time-traveling Borg movie. Hanks might well have brought an extra layer of charm to the role, which was finally  played by the most excellent James Cromwell instead. Plus Hanks actually sort of looked like Glenn Corbett, who played the role on television. In any case, if Hanks had joined the <em>First Contact</em> cast, Pascale believes this could have massively increased the film's box office and cemented Trek's status as a pop culture juggernaut.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="450" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18mygf7b19uw9jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>8) Not taking the premise of Star Trek: Voyager seriously</h4>
<p><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> had a really simple but fascinating premise: a starship cut off from the rest of the Federation, forced to survive on its own for years or decades... and some of the crewmembers are already people who'd rebelled against the Federation. Sadly, the show's creators didn't want to invest in this premise, including basic things like &quot;running out of photon torpedos&quot; or &quot;being unable to make some repairs,&quot; and they were allergic to any real conflict among the characters. Most notably, when <em>Deep Space Nine</em> ended and Ronald D. Moore joined the writing staff, Moore pushed for slightly more realism in the depiction of life on the other side of the galaxy — and wound up having to leave the show after just one episode.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="452" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18myggyg222o6jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>9) No fifth season of Enterprise</h4>
<p>The <em>Star Trek</em> prequel was the first <em>Trek</em> show to get less than seven seasons since the <em>Original Series</em> — and it ended &quot;just when the show was getting good,&quot; says Pascale. At long last, <em>Enterprise </em>had stopped getting mired in Temporal Cold War shenanigans and had started exploring the origins of the Federation. New showrunner Manny Coto (<em>Odyssey 5</em>) had tons of great ideas for building on the <em>Trek</em> legacy, which we would have seen if the show had lasted one more year. But it was too late — the show had already lost too many viewers by the time Coto started turning the ship around.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="209" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18mygl0ggt93sjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<h4>10) No Star Trek: Federation</h4>
<p><em>Star Trek</em> needed a long rest after <em>Enterprise</em> went off the air — from 1986 to 2005, the series had constantly been on television and at the movies. Not to mention <a href="http://kotaku.com/the-visual-evolution-of-star-trek-video-games-482664959" target="_blank">tons of games</a><inset id="482664959"></inset>. But <em>Trek</em> really needs a new TV show now — especially one that goes further into the future and starts exploring the Big Questions again. And Bryan Singer <a href="http://io9.com/5793606/what-would-william-shatner-and-bryan-singers-star-trek-tv-shows-have-been-about">toyed with the idea of pitching a brand new Trek show</a><inset id="5793606"></inset> during the making of Superman Returns, with input from Burnett and Geoffrey Thorne. You can read tons of details here, but in a nutshell Federation would have taken place in the far future, after the Federation has become &quot;fat and happy,&quot; and needs a new Enterprise and a new Kirk to inspire it. And meanwhile, a brand new threat called the Scourge threatens to destroy everything humanity has built. It definitely sounds like the sort of thing that could make Trek exciting and thought-provoking again — and Pascale points out that there are tons of other TV show pitches sitting in drawers, waiting for someone at CBS to be willing to pick up the phone. Maybe after this next movie, we'll finally get to see a new <em>Trek</em> on the small screen?</p>

<p class="first-text">A mysterious carcass washed ashore in New Zealand last week, fueling speculation about sea monsters and dinosaurs. The rotting animal was discovered by a group on four-wheel vehicles speeding along the beach in Bay of Plenty.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.sunlive.co.nz/news/43115-prehistoric-whale-washup.html" target="_blank">a story in New Zealand’s </a><a href="http://www.sunlive.co.nz/news/43115-prehistoric-whale-washup.html" target="_blank"><em>Sun Live</em></a> newspaper, “beachgoers were stumped when they came across what they thought was a prehistoric creature on the shore… stretching about 9 meters (30 feet) in length with large teeth and rudimentary flippers.”</p>
<p>Video of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=sumif3fCDH4" target="_blank">fearsome-looking animal</a> was soon posted to YouTube, asking the public for help in figuring out what it was.</p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="300" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18mxsz5v9cyl0png/original.png" class="transform-original"/></p><p>A marine biologist soon <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/Prehistoric-animal-mystery-solved/tabid/1160/articleID/296049/Default.aspx" target="_blank">identified the remains</a> as a killer whale, in part because of its distinctive flipper. The mystery was solved, but it’s not the first time an animal’s carcass has been mistaken for a monster. In fact, New Zealand is one of the most common places in the world — along with Newfoundland, Canada and Florida — for such “sea monsters” to appear.</p>
<h4>The Science of Sea Monsters</h4>
<p>Over the past centuries mysterious masses of marine flesh have occasionally washed ashore on beaches around the world. Dubbed “blobsters” (or simply “blobs”) these large carcasses are so badly decomposed there’s not enough material to make a definitive identification. To many people, the huge creatures — looking unlike any known animal — may seem like strong evidence for sea monsters or even existing dinosaurs.</p>
<p>In 1896, giant waves tossed a massive fleshy corpse on a beach at St. Augustine, Fla. The rubbery, 6-foot-high blob was examined by a local naturalist, who decided it was likely from a giant octopus far larger than any known type. Many other such blobs have been found, including the horror-film inspired <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3041884.stm" target="_blank">“Chilean blob”</a> (found in July 2003), a few “Bermuda blobs,” and another in Newfoundland in 2001.</p>
<p>Controversy and mystery surrounded the creatures for decades. In 2004, a team of biologists led by Sidney Pierce examined all available blobster materials using electron microscopes, and applied biochemical, molecular and DNA analysis. The conclusion: The strange specimens were actually various species of great whales.</p>
<p>Though the identities of these mysterious monster carcasses are now known, marine mystery lovers need not fret. The oceans have not been fully explored, and it’s certain that the sea has not revealed all its secrets.</p>

<h3>Excerpt from the introduction to <em>Paleofantasy</em>:</h3>
<p><strong>Our maladapted ancestors</strong></p>
<p>The paleofantasy is a fantasy in part because it supposes that we humans, or at least our protohuman forebears, were at some point perfectly adapted to our environments. We apply this erroneous idea of evolution producing the ideal mesh between organism and surroundings to other life-forms too, not just to people. We seem to have a vague idea that long long ago, when organisms were emerging from the primordial slime, they were rough-hewn approximations of their eventual shape, like toys hastily carved from wood, or an artist’s first rendition of a portrait, with holes where the eyes and mouth eventually will be. Then, the thinking goes, the animals were subject to the forces of nature. Those in the desert got better at resisting the sun, while those in the cold evolved fur or blubber or the ability to use fire. Once those traits had appeared and spread in the population, we had not a kind of sketch, but a fully realized organism, a fait accompli, with all of the lovely details executed, the anatomical t’s crossed and i’s dotted.</p>
<p>But of course that isn’t true. Although we can admire a stick insect that seems to flawlessly imitate a leafy twig in every detail, down to the marks of faux bird droppings on its wings, or a sled dog with legs that can withstand subzero temperatures because of the exquisite heat exchange between its blood vessels, both are full of compromises, jury-rigged like all other organisms. The insect has to resist disease, as well as blend into its background; the dog must run and find food, as well as stay warm. The pigment used to form those dark specks on the insect is also useful in the insect immune system, and using it in one place means it can’t be used in another. For the dog, having long legs for running can make it harder to keep the cold at bay, since more heat is lost from narrow limbs than from wider ones. These often conflicting needs mean automatic trade-offs in every system, so that each may be good enough but is rarely if ever perfect. Neither we nor any other species have ever been a seamless match with the environment. Instead, our adaptation is more like a broken zipper, with some teeth that align and others that gape apart. Except that it looks broken only to our unrealistically perfectionist eyes—eyes that themselves contain oddly looped vessels as a holdover from their past.</p>
<p>Even without these compromises from natural selection acting on our current selves, we have trade-offs and “good enough”  solutions that linger from our evolutionary history. Humans are built on a vertebrate plan that carries with it oddities that make sense if you are a fish, but not a terrestrial biped. The paleontologist Neal Shubin points out that our inner fish constrains the human body’s performance and health because adaptations that arose in one environment bedevil us in another. Hiccups, hernias, and hemorrhoids are all caused by an imperfect transfer of anatomical technology from our fish ancestors. These problems haven’t disappeared for a number of reasons: just by chance, no genetic variants have been born that lacked the detrimental traits, or, more likely, altering one’s esophagus to prevent hiccups would entail unacceptable changes in another part of the anatomy. If something works well enough for the moment, at least long enough for its bearer to reproduce, that’s enough for evolution.</p>
<p>We can acknowledge that evolution is continuous, but still it seems hard to comprehend that this means each generation can differ infinitesimally from the one before, without a cosmic moment when a frog or a monkey looked down at itself, pronounced itself satisfied, and said, “Voilà, I am done.” Our bodies therefore reflect a continuously jury-rigged system with echoes of fish, of fruit fly, of lizard and mouse. Wanting to be more like our ancestors just means wanting more of the same set of compromises.</p>
<p><strong>When was that utopia again?</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing the continuity of evolution also makes clear the futility of selecting any particular time period for human harmony. Why would we be any more likely to feel out of sync than those who came before us? Did we really spend hundreds of thousands of years in stasis, perfectly adapted to our environments? When during the past did we attain this adaptation, and how did we know when to stop?</p>
<p>If they had known about evolution, would our cave-dwelling forebears have felt nostalgia for the days before they were bipedal, when life was good and the trees were a comfort zone? Scavenging prey from more formidable predators, similar to what modern hyenas do, is thought to have preceded, or at least accompanied, actual hunting in human history. Were, then, those early hunter-gatherers convinced that swiping a gazelle from the lion that caught it was superior to that newfangled business of running it down yourself? And why stop there? Why not long to be aquatic, since life arose in the sea? In some ways, our lungs are still ill suited to breathing air. For that matter, it might be nice to be unicellular: after all, cancer arises because our differentiated tissues run amok. Single cells don’t get cancer.</p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="445" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18mwbb8qt3r65jpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>Even assuming we could agree on a time to hark back to, there is the sticky issue of exactly what such an ancestral nirvana was like. Do we follow the example of the modern hunter-gatherers living a subsistence existence in a few remaining parts of the world? What about the great apes, the animals that most closely resemble the ancestors we (and they) split off from millions of years ago? How much can we deduce from fossils? People were what anthropologists call “anatomically modern,” meaning that they looked more or less like us, by about 200,000 years ago, but it’s far less clear when “behaviorally modern”  humans arose, or what exactly they did. So, trying to deduce the classic lifestyle from which we’ve now deviated is itself a bit of a gamble. In his book Before the Dawn, science writer Nicholas Wade points out, “It is tempting to suppose that our ancestors were just like us except where there is evidence to the contrary. This is a hazardous assumption.”<sup><br/></sup></p>
<p>You might argue that hunter-gatherers, or the cavemen of our paleofantasies, were better adapted to their environment simply because they spent many thousands of years in it—much longer than we’ve spent sitting in front of a computer or eating Mars bars. That’s true for some attributes, but not all. Continued selection in a stable environment, as might occur in the deep sea, can indeed cause ever more finely honed adaptations, as the same kinds of less successful individuals are weeded out of the population. But such rock-solid stability is rare in the world; the Pleistocene varied considerably in its climate over the course of thousands of years, and when people move around, even small shifts in the habitat in which they live, going from warm to cool, from savanna to forest, can pose substantially new evolutionary challenges. Even in perfectly stable environments, trade-offs persist; you can’t give birth to large-brained infants and also walk on two legs trouble-free, no matter how long you try.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it’s important to dispel the myth that modern humans are operating in a completely new environment because we only recently began to live as long as we do now, whereas our ancestors, or the average hunter-gatherer, lived only until thirty or forty, and hence never had to experience age-related diseases. While it is absolutely true that the average life span of a human being has increased enormously over just the last few centuries, this does not mean that thousands of years ago people were hale and hearty until thirty-five and then suddenly dropped dead.</p>
<p>An average life expectancy is just that—an average of all the ages that the people in the population attain before they die. A life expectancy of less than forty can occur without a single individual dying at or even near that age if, for example, childhood mortality from diseases such as measles or malaria is high—a common pattern in developing countries. Suppose you have a village of 100 people. If half of them die at age five, perhaps from such childhood ailments, twenty die at age sixty, and the remaining thirty die at seventy-five, the average life span in the society is thirty-seven, but not a single person actually reached the age of thirty hale and hearty and then suddenly began to senesce. The same pattern writ large is what makes the life expectancy in developing countries so shockingly low. It isn’t that people in sub-Saharan Africa or ancient Rome never experienced old age; it’s that few of them survived their childhood diseases. Average life expectancy is not the same thing as the age at which most people die. Old age is not a recent invention, but its commonness is.</p>
<p><strong>The pace of change</strong></p>
<p>If we do not look to a mythical past utopia for clues to a way forward, what next? The answer is that we start asking different questions. Instead of bemoaning our unsuitability to modern life, we can wonder why some traits evolve quickly and some slowly. How do we know what we do about the rate at which evolution occurs? If lactose tolerance can become established in a population over just a handful of generations, what about an ability to digest and thrive on refined grains, the bugaboo of the paleo diet? Breakthroughs in genomics (the study of the entire set of genes in an organism) and other genetic technologies now allow us to determine how quickly individual genes and gene blocks have been altered in response to natural selection. Evidence is mounting that numerous human genes have changed over just the last few thousand years—a blink of an eye, evolutionarily speaking—while others are the same as they have been for millions of years, relatively unchanged from the form we share with ancestors as distant as worms and yeast. The pages to come will explore which genes and traits have changed, which have not, how we know, and why it matters.</p>
<p>What’s more, a new field called experimental evolution is showing us that sometimes evolution occurs before our eyes, with rapid adaptations happening in 100, 50, or even a dozen or fewer generations. Depending on the life span of the organism, that could mean less than a year, or perhaps a quarter century. It is most easily demonstrated in the laboratory, but increasingly, now that we know what to look for, we are seeing it in the wild. And although humans are evolving all the time, it is often easier to see the process in other kinds of organisms. Humans are not the only species whose environment has changed dramatically over the last few hundred years, or even the last few decades. Some of the work my students and I have been doing on crickets found in the Hawaiian Islands and in the rest of the Pacific shows that a completely new trait, a wing mutation that renders males silent, spread in just five years, fewer than twenty generations. It is the equivalent of humans becoming involuntarily mute during the time between the publication of the Gutenberg Bible and On the Origin of Species. This and similar research on animals is shedding light on which traits are likely to evolve quickly and under what circumstances, because we can test our ideas in real time under controlled conditions.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, our understanding of such rapid evolution, also called “evolution in ecological timescales,” has increased enormously. And studying the rate of evolution also has practical implications. For example, fishermen often take the largest specimens of salmon or trout from streams and rivers. Fish usually need to reach a certain size before becoming sexually mature and capable of reproduction, after which growth slows down. Like other animals, fish show a trade-off between large size and time of reproduction: if you wait to be large before producing offspring, you probably will be able to produce more of them, and having greater numbers of offspring is favored by evolution, but you also risk dying before you are able to reproduce at all. But where overfishing has removed a substantial portion of a population, the average size of fish is now substantially smaller, because the fishermen have inadvertently selected for earlier reproduction, and evolution has favored fish that get to the business of sex sooner. It’s not just that the larger fish have all been taken; it’s that the fish are not reaching such sizes to begin with. The genes responsible for regulating growth and size at sexual maturity are now different because evolution has occurred. To bring back the jaw-dropping trophy fish of decades past, scientists say, people will have to change their ways.</p>
<p>It’s common for people talk about how we were “meant”  to be, in areas ranging from diet to exercise to sex and family. Yet these notions are often flawed, making us unnecessarily wary of new foods and, in the long run, new ideas. I would not dream of denying the evolutionary heritage present in our bodies—and our minds. And it is clear that a life of sloth with a diet of junk food isn’t doing us any favors. But to assume that we evolved until we reached a particular point and now are unlikely to change for the rest of history, or to view ourselves as relics hampered by a self-inflicted mismatch between our environment and our genes, is to miss out on some of the most exciting new developments in evolutionary biology.</p>

<p>Two elegant geeks posed for a fur-trimmed engagement shoot inspired by <em>Game of Thrones., </em>and it's pretty gorgeous (then again anything remotely related to Robb Stark gets two thumbs up in our books). Besides, the groom in Ramon and Emelia's photos from <a href="http://www.fandi.es/web/index.php" target="_blank">Fandi.es</a> definitely has a bit of dire wolf in him.

<p class="first-text">Ever wonder what it would be like to have your head chopped off? Well, you may soon get the chance to find out. A group of independent developers has created a <strong>guillotine simulator</strong> using the <strong>Oculus Rift</strong> virtual reality headset. </p>
<p>During the experience, you can look behind yourself to see the blade coming down, followed by your POV trip to the bottom of a head-catching basket. The simulation can be enhanced by having someone chop their hand down on the back of your neck as is happens. Such fun. </p>
<p>The program, called <strong>Disunion</strong>, was made during the recent <a href="http://exile.dk/" target="_blank">Exile Game Jam</a> by Erkki Trummal, André Berlemont, and Morten Brunbjerg. It's unlikely that the simulator will become anything serious; the developers were probably just experimenting with the possibilities.</p>

<p class="first-text">So when I told the <em>Defiance</em> showrunners to focus on characters instead of CG in<a href="http://io9.com/when-defiance-isnt-copying-other-scifi-series-its-en-485821164"> last week’s recap</a><inset id="485821164"></inset>? Clearly, they listened. And then went back in time and wrote and filmed “ A Well-Respected Man,” which was one hell of a good episode where every character featured got a moment to really, truly develop. You’re welcome, everybody!</p>
<p>Let’s start with the plot, which was easily the least interesting part of the episode — and indeed, even the episode barely focused on it. Short version (although even the long-version is still pretty short): Kendra, NeedWant’s owner/proprietor/head prostitute chases one of her girls who stole her john's scrip into Defiance’s slums, where she accidently sees Datak Tarr’s Bioman (the blue bodybuilder from the pilot) with a truck full of clearly kidnapped bums and drug addicts. The Bioman knocks out both Kenya and her employee, and takes the whole lot of them to a spot out of town, where the Bioman's friend has a factory where he sucks all the adrenalin out of people to make a drug, using what is essentially The Matrix Jr. Seriously, I can’t tell you how little time the episode focus on this, and it’s awesome, because here’s the stuff that <em>really</em> happens:</p>
<p>Nolan, who is still pissed at Datak Tarr for killing that Casthitan after the Mayor pardoned him, intercepts a secret shipment of weapons Datak is importing. Except Datak actually bought the weapons <em>for</em> the town, secretly, on behalf of the Town Council, because Defiance’s shield is down and the town needs protecting; Datak is the guy with the connections ot weapons dealers. Unfortunately, the Town Council didn’t tell this plan to the mayor, probably because she knew they’d freak, which means the Mayor was unable to tell Nolan. Which means Nolan just cost Defiance the massive deposit the town paid for the rest of the weapons.</p>
<p>Next, Amanda has a scene with her sister Kenya where she gives her shit for being a prostitute, and Kenya just completely blows it off. It’s pretty great. Although to be fair, Amanda was pretty half-hearted about the criticism and it seemed more like she needed to blow off some steam after the weapons snafu and a crazy woman accosted her on the street (see “Assorted Musings” below) than she actually disapproved ofKenya’s profession. Besides, the scene is nothing but a contrivance for Amanda to feel extra bad after Kenya’s kidnapped anyways.</p>
<p>So Nolan and Amanda (who seems to spend a large part of her job tagging along with the sheriff) start hunting for Kenya. The first clue? A young boy who picked up Kenya’s locket, which she dropped when she kidnapped. This kid is <em>awesome</em>. He’s standing in front of the town mayor and the sheriff with stolen property, and <em>he does not give a shit</em>. In fact, when questioned by Nolan, the kid demands money before he tells them anything  — and then, after he’s paid, <em>he tries to run off</em>! He’s got balls bigger than he is! I mention this because this is absolutely a one-note expository character, designed solely to give the protagonists information, but <em>Defiance</em> imbues him with an actual personality. It’s a big step for the show, not just in terms of making sure its characters have personality, but making the world of <em>Defiance</em> seem more real.</p>
<p>The kid tells them about the Bioman, and since Datak Tarr has the only Bioman in town, Nolan and Amanda rouse Datak from his slumber in the middle of the night, where Nolan immediately accosts him. Not only is this the exact wrong way to get information about someone as touchy about respect as Datak is, the episode doesn’t let Nolan off the hook for being wrong — the entire investigation effectively breaks down because of his hotheadedness (albeit it just for a little bit).</p>
<p>Datak, who’s been trying to achieve a level of respect equal to his power and wealth, would almost certainly have been willing to help the mayor, if only to be the town hero for a bit. But Nolan’s fuck-up, along with a lot of long-simmering resentments — most notably being excluded from the town council, despite being a major player and the dude the town calls any time they need anything slightly illicit done — boils over, and he gives a massive speech about how the town is happy to use him, but not recognize him, and that’s why he won’t help Amanda find her sister. You know what’s most amazing about this? Every single word Datak says is true.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="853" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18my1qut5sqgvjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p>And here’s where things start to get <em>extra</em> awesome. Stahma slips out after everybody leaves, and tracks down Amanda. She gives two very important bits of information about Kenya: 1) she calls her girls “night potrders,” which Stahma seems to think is a sign of pride in her work. I find the name odd, but I appreciate the sentiment. 2) Stahma likes Kenya, because when the first time they ran into each other on the street, Kenya runs up to her and hugs her and says, “Datak is an amazing man; thank you for sharing him with me.”</p>
<p>This is fucking amazing, and let me tell you why: This, as Stahma herself points, is exactly what she needed. Sure, prostitution is legal and it seems like Casthithans aren’t as prudish about sex as even future humans are. But no spouse would feel good about her/his partner seeking physical pleasure elsewhere, even if society was cool with it. What Kenya does is turn this act of exclusion into an act of inclusion; by thanking her, Kenya shows Stahma the respect she needs in an awkward situation, and praising Datak she appeals not just to her honor but the whole family’s honor, and by calling it sharing, Kenya acknowledges she is only a small factor in the broader scope of Datak and Stahma’s relationship. It’s brilliant, not just an act in the story, but also in thet writing. Kenya is a woman who knows what everyone needs, and this revelation not only instantly makes her fascinating to me, but does more for her character than any scene she’s actually been in.</p>
<p>And that’s not all. Stahma also turns the situation to Datak’s — and he family’s — advantage, by pointing out that Datak’s immense pride has been hurt (again, justly so). To get his help, to save her own sister’s life, Amanda will have to show Datak respect — and what could afford more respect than finally awarding Datak his own seat on the town council? It’s great plotting by Stahma, and equally great plotting by <em>Defiance</em>. After last week’s dull affair, I wasn’t sure if <em>Defiance</em> had this level of storytelling in it, but it does, and when it does the show is genuinely excellent.</p>
<p>Obviously, the next scene is Nolan and Datak tracking down leads. Datak brings Nolan to a Castithan associate of the Bioman (possibly a lover?). Again, I was expecting simple information-relating, but the scene is so much more: Nolan sees a fresh cut on the informant’s face, and immediately susses out that Datak’s goons got there earlier, roughed the Castithan up, got the information, then forced him to stage this whole elaborate scene so Nolan’s thuggery would look worthless while Datak swoops in at the end to break the guy and be the hero. Better yet, Nolan totally calls Datak on this. Best of all, Datak just admits it — respecting Nolan enough to at least cut out the bullshit. Turns out the Bioman hangs out with that skuzzy adrenalin drug user/maker a few clicks out of town, and then Nolan — and Amanda, because what else does she have to do other than go to armed conflicts — rescue Kenya with no problem whatsoever.</p>
<p>But the episode isn’t over! Kenya gets her necklace back — which apparently features St. Finnegan, protector of lost children, on it — and tries to give it to the wayward, drug-addicted prostitute she was kidnapped with. I was dead certain <em>Defiance</em> would make this a completely unearned, schmaltzy moment, but instead the girl looks at the pendant, tells Kenya St. Finnegan is bullshit, which she knows because she was raised by nuns, and then walks off with a “Thanks anyways!”</p>
<p>As it turns out — as we see in a flashback, bits of which have been popping up throughut the episode, just like Irisa’s visions in last week’s episode — Amanda made up the saint when she gave the necklace to Kenya as a kid, right after their mother had abandoned both of them in a war zone. First of all, a mom leaving her children while bombs are dropping all around is fucking dark. Second, the reveal that St. Finnegan was made up actually got me; I was surprised, and it made the resulting schmaltzy scene where Amanda admits her deception to Kenya work for me.</p>
<p>And last but not least, Quentin McCawley sees his dad has closed off his murdered brother Luke’s mine, which he was supposed to have. Viewers know that Rafe found that gold thingie hidden in Luke’s desk last week, and it's easy to surmise that Luke must have found it in his mine — which is obviously why Rafe closed the mine. Quentin doesn’t know any of this, and assumes it's because his dad doesn’t trust him or like him, which isn’t implausible but is pretty standard family drama. What I like is that the show trusts the audience to figure all this out <em>before</em> Rafe hands Quentin the gold thingie and explains what the deal is. Honestly, as simple a thing as this is, the fact that the show no longer feels the need to spell out every single detail might be the best sign of all that <em>Defiance</em> has found its footing.</p>
<p>I’m a little less enthused when Rafe and Quentin go down into the mind together, and see cave drawings of of the gold thingie and some other thingies; this is obviously related to what the Evil Ex-Mayor wants to kill Defiance for, but cave drawings are Twist at the End of the Episode 101. I’ll need more before I’m invested in this as the overall plot, but after this week’s episode, I’m more than happy to come along for the ride.</p>

<p><strong>Assorted Musings:</strong></p>
<p>• Sorry for the lack of photos; SyFy just… forgot, I guess? …to release the pics for this episode. No big deal, SyFy. It’s not like you spent $100 million on this thing. Probably a waste of time to promote it at this point anyways.</p>
<p>• The woman who accosts Amanda is pissed that her husband keeps employing Kenya’s services, and it’s ludicrous. Not only is it legal, it’s not like Kenya’s making the dude have sex with her. That’s like me getting furious at my bourbon when I get drunk. DAMN YOU BOURBON, WHY DO YOU MAKE ME LOVE YOU SO MUCH</p>
<p>• Nolan, it should also be noted, has been paying Kenya for sex at the NeedWant all this time, which I like because it gives Nolan a bit of an edge.</p>
<p>• In the town council meeting, the council is mostly for the Earth Federation or whatever it’s called to build a mag-lev railway into town, although Amanda’s against it. Usually, this sort of progress is invariably seen as good (if a touch sad; see pretty much every Western as evidence). Does <em>Defiance</em> really think connecting to the outside world is a bad thing, or has Amanda been poisoned by the previous mayor, who was also opposed to it? An interesting question, and one I’m eager to find out.</p>
<p>• Not only does a lady hire one of Kenya’s lady “night porters,” it’s intimated that Datak’s Bioman has a thing for male Casthithans (even old and not very attractive ones), again, with absolutely no attention or comment called to either. <em>Defiance</em>: The most quietly progressive show on TV?</p>
<p>• Another nice moment: Nolan explaining what the adrenalin drug is, and that it started out synthetically made, but then had to be harvested from human’s adrenal glands. He explains he was forced to take it back when he was a soldier, and doesn’t clarify which type he took. I’m getting the feeling there’s a whole lot about the war that we don’t know, and if <em>Defiance</em> ever gets the chance to reveal it to us, it’s going to blow our minds. But I might just be extra optimistic after watching the episode.</p>
<p>• Anyone know what the hell a “hailer” is? Did I miss that somewhere?</p>
<p>• Could the Bioman and the drug user have been any more <em>Of Mice and Men</em>?</p>
<p>• And could “The Maze” been less scary? Of course it could, it had a Volge running around through it, chasing its captors. But it also could have been waaaaaay scarier.</p>
<p>• I can’t decide who the series MVP is, but it’s definitely a Tarr. I originally thought Jaime Murray as Stahma was the most clever character, but while she’s very smart and scheme-y, she pretty much stays smart and scheme-0. Meanwhile, Tony Curran as Datak is just killing it — Datak is the most layered, complex character in the show. At any rate, the Tarrs make the McCawleys look like the Beverly Hillbillies.</p>
<p> • I just looked Tony Curran up on IMDB and discovered he played Vincetnt Van Gogh in that awesome <em>Doctor Who</em> episode. Niiice.</p>
<p>• So I guess the Evil Ex-Mayor stepped down a few months ago, appointed Amanda to succeed her, and there just happens to be an actual election in a few more months? That makes sense, but <em>Defiance</em> did a kind of crappy job explaining it.</p>
<p>• Speaking of, if the election is just a few weeks away, shouldn’t Amanda have… an opponent?</p>
<p>• More good storytelling: Datak enters the town council meeting, and you can see how everybody feels about his appointment when they shake his hand. Some are disgusted, some are clearly partners or bought off. An excellent example of showing instead of telling.</p>
<p>• “Close enough. But for the record, I had no intention of whispering in this disgusting man’s ear.” Oh, Datak, you are a <em>delight</em>.</p>
<p>• Stupidest moment of the night: Young Kenya playing hopscotch while bombs literally fall around her. I know you want to present young Kenya as an innocent child, <em>Defiance</em>, but come on. That’s some Michael Bay level of symbolism right there.</p>
<p>• So about those cave drawings: Do you think they’re supposed to be ancient, like maybe these aliens visited us thousands of years ago, or that they’re just from a group that stopped in that cave during the war? I assumed the latter, but if anyone disagrees please let me know.</p>
<p>• Kenya stopped taking Nolan’s money after weeks or even months, but Podrick of <em>Game of Thrones</em> got four professional sex workers with a very scary pimp to refund all his money after one afternoon. Podrick &gt; Nolan, is what I’m saying.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"tv recap";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"defiance";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"defiance recap";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"syfy";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"television";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Tue, 7 May 2013 15:00:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"493767723";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Rob Bricken";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"The long-running mystery of why birds seemingly change sex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://io9.com/the-long-running-mystery-of-why-birds-seemingly-change-493154825";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3421:"<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18muxt41qbm35jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p class="first-text">It's not often you do a search on a scientific subject and come up with a journal from 1888, but people were puzzled by this mystery for a while:  Female birds, usually once they've reached a sufficiently advanced age, can suddenly grow male plumage and take on male behaviors.</p>
<p>I read in a book that, seemingly at random, female birds could start growing male plumage.  Intrigued, I did a quick search for why, and got a journal article entitled, &quot;On the Occasional Assumption of the Male Plumage by Female Birds,&quot; which dated back to 1888.  That article, which I found a little old-fashioned, started out by sniffing at the quaint old-fashioned conceits of another article written in 1780.  Obviously, this question has gone back a long time, puzzling many scientists.</p>
<p>Some of these early scientists were confused by a red herring — the fact that sometimes female birds developed patches of male plumage.  Some birds were completely divided, one half of them being male and one half of them being female.  This condition, known as <a href="http://io9.com/5810962/bilateral-gynandromorphism-a-fancy-way-of-saying-youre-literally-half-male-and-half-female">bilateral gynandromorphism</a><inset id="5810962"></inset>, is the result of genetic mosaicism.  For whatever reason, a clump of cells with male chromosomes gets attached to a clump of cells with female chromosomes and knit together into one animal.  This gave scientists a lot of information that unfortunately was completely misleading.  The sudden appearance of male plumage on female birds is not genetic at all.</p>
<p>When people began dissecting female birds that suddenly displayed male plumage, the found atrophied or nonfunctioning ovaries.  When they removed the ovaries from healthy female birds, many of them began developing male plumage.  Estrogen is the only thing that keeps female birds camouflaged in browns and grays.  As ovaries age and stop working, or if they for some reason sustain damage, the sudden loss of estrogen causes females to grow vivid plumage, and even start calling or crowing like male birds.  This is most often observed in chickens — since they're the most commonly observed birds — but it's been shown to happen in golden pheasants and even peacocks.  As females peahens age, they will often grow full peacock tails, the way male peacocks do, although they won't fan them.  We think of male plumage as an extravagance that is added to birds.  It seems as if it's more of a default that needs to be hormonally suppressed to keep from showing up.</p>

<p class="first-text">It's called <strong>The Periodic Table of Middle-Earth</strong> and it was put together by <strong>Emil Johansson</strong> — a devoted Tolkien fan and an aspiring chemical engineer. Which this awesome chart makes blazingly obvious. </p>
<p>As you can see, Johansson has replaced the standard chemical elements with characters from <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em>.</p>
<p>Each character is organized according to race (including Gothmog, who belongs to no known race) and is given a unique symbol and number. Johansson has even added birth and death dates — and a special symbol to denote wearers of the ring. </p>

<h4>Star Trek Into Darkness</h4>
<p>Co-writer Damon Lindelof explains why a major event in the first <em>Star Trek</em> meant the sequel could never unfold like the original series did, even on one of the most basic of levels:</p>
<blockquote>The first question we were facing, just on a plot level, is can there be a five-year mission when Vulcan blew up? How did that attack — which is essentially a 9/11-like incident in Federation lore — change history? That should be the catalyst for everything that happens in the second movie, so that was the conversation that happened when we initially made the decision to destroy Vulcan, because it's a huge deal. The two key planets in the Federation are Vulcan and Earth, and now one of them is just gone, and it eradicated billions of lives, so we need to talk about that and understand what the ramifications are moving forward. Secondly, I think in the first series of meetings for the second movie, we knew what the first movie was, emotionally, and it was about these people getting to meet each other. It was a philosophical study of logic versus emotion, and ultimately landing on this idea that the two can't be separate. They need each other, and those ideas are represented by Kirk and Spock.</blockquote>

<h4>Star Trek 3</h4>
<p>And looking further ahead, Damon Lindelof suggests the Klingons could well be the main enemy of the next <em>Star Trek</em> movie. Here's what he said, in response to a question about whether the team already has plans for the third film:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;I think that is a reasonable conclusion. You should always know where you've been, you should always know where you are, but most importantly, and I learned this from Lost, you should know where you're going... You can never see enough Klingons, and I think in this film we've given the audience a little taste, but there's also a promise that there's a larger conflict on the horizon, and that would be fun to see.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>He also suggests that this new incarnation of the franchise could one day incorporate elements from <em>The Next Generation</em>:</p>
<blockquote>You can't talk about Trek and not talk about the Borg, and certainly about Q. Very iconic adversaries from The Next Generation which is, outside of the original cast films, was my entry way into Star Trek, so I wouldn't mind getting – towards the end of our run on Star Trek, maybe baby Picard could be born. There has to be some sort of crossover we're not thinking of.</blockquote>

<h4>Star Wars: Episode VII</h4>
<p>Bad Robot producer Bryan Burk says the movie will likely start filming in 2014:</p>
<blockquote>We're progressing on a schedule to hopefully begin next year, or the beginning of next year, and the location is still kind of floating around in the air all depending on script and a whole bunch of other issues. As I just said, everything is kind of a free-flowing thing, and when we feel like the story level on this script and everything is really coming together and schedules are all working and pieces line up, we prowl ahead, and Star Wars will be no different.</blockquote>
<p>[<a href="http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-7-filming-2014-bryan-burk/" target="_blank">Collider</a>]</p>
<p>So that's <em>when</em> the movie might start shooting, but what about <em>where</em>? Well, if you believe <em>The Sun</em> — which you probably shouldn't, but let's just roll with it — one filming location could be Scotland. The report quotes this supposed inside source, which might be bullshit, but what the hey:</p>
<blockquote>“Location bosses feel Scotland possesses stunning scenery perfect for movie backdrops. They will look great on the big screen and the rock formations will replicate the perception of mountainous planets. It will be the first time Star Wars has ever been shot north of the border.”</blockquote>
<p>Early location scouting is certainly conceivable, but it should be pointed out that Michael Arndt's screenplay probably still isn't finished yet, so the story could still change to the extent that Scottish exteriors would no longer make sense... again, assuming the original report is credible in the first place. Still, the thought of filming a <em>Star Wars</em> film in an actual <em>location</em> is an appealing one indeed. [<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/4914537/Its-Skye-Wars-as-Scotland-is-set-to-star-in-sci-fi-smash.html" target="_blank">The Sun</a>]</p>
<p>Mark Hamill once again effortlessly proved that Mark Hamill is the best with a recent appearance at the CapeTown Film Festival, in which he discussed his own hopes for the next trilogy:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;I've only had one creative meeting about the new films, but I do remember saying, ‘We've got to find a proper balance between CGI and old school [FX]. That's what the challenge is, is to try and meet expectations of what you guys want. I think there's nothing wrong with CGI, but I think you have to have a balance, because the camera perceives the width and the depth and the weight – even if it's a miniature model, the camera just realizes that. So when you have too much CGI and the clouds are CGI and the trees are CGI and the buildings are CGI, you're getting to a point where the figure in the shot is like a hybrid of an animated film and live-action. And I want it to have an organic look so that we don't get into Roger Rabbit territory.&quot; He then added, with a laugh, &quot;But I don't imagine that the priority is what I want!&quot;</blockquote>
<p>There's more general Mark Hamill awesomeness at the link, including a spirited defense of the prequels that might not be <em>right</em>, exactly, but is still eminently respectable. [<a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/05/star-wars-episode-vii-mark-hamill-on-his-hope-for-a-balance-between-cgi-and-old-school-fx" target="_blank">IGN</a>]</p>
<p>And screenwriter Simon Kinberg, whose previous credits include <em>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</em> and <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em> and who is currently working on a standalone <em>Star Wars</em> script, discusses his approach to the material:</p>
<blockquote>We're really at the early phases of figuring out the details, but the spirit of the original movie is the thing I fell in love with, so it's the spirit of that that I think will guide us. <br/><br/><strong>Larry Kasdan said that what sets the original movies apart is that they're more about people than the films that followed. Do you plan to take this new film back in that direction?</strong> <br/>Completely. I think what worked so well in all of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies is the characters. I think the reason that they're different than other science fiction or other genre movies is because George [Lucas] created a universe of people that you wanted to go back and see over and over again, and that's why it's spanned and spawned so many different mediums, so many different generations, every different language. You want to go back and see those characters, like I did when I was a kid. &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; was the first movie I saw in a movie theater more than once. And I went back 10, 15 times in the theater, and I've seen it probably over a 100 times since. But I saw it that many times in the theater because I loved those characters. I loved Han, I loved Leia, I loved Luke, I was right at the age when I was old enough to start to understand the nuance of that movie. I think I was too young for &quot;New Hope&quot; when it came out in the theater, although I loved it and it was my favorite film until &quot;Empire.&quot; And then really, that changed my life, that movie.</blockquote>

<h4>Avatar 2 and 3</h4>
<p>Star Zoe Saldana suggests 2014 is a likely filming date for the two sequels:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;I think that they're doing a part two and a part three and they're probably going to shoot it at the same time...If we just do two and then wait, I'll probably be 45 or 50 by the time we get to part three. It takes a long time, it's a very hard process.&quot;</blockquote>

<h4>Under the Dome</h4>
<p>Comics genius Brian K. Vaughan, who is the showrunner of CBS's summer adaptation of the Stephen King novel, explains the structure of the season and how the series might depart from the book:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;The first section is fate. The second section is fear. And the third section is fascism. I won't say who is the fascist or what exactly that means, but I think you get the sense that things are going to go wrong very quickly under the dome, and we're going to need an iron fist keeping order... There's sort of a perhaps slightly different explanation for the dome. I nervously pitched Stephen King what a different version of the ending might be. He was very supportive of it, and very complimentary. He said, ‘I wish I'd thought of that.' Which I suspect is just Stephen being kind, but he's been great.&quot;</blockquote>

<h4>Revolution</h4>
<p>Creator Eric Kripke discusses what's ahead on the show, starting with another battle between Miles and Monroe:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;They have another confrontation and sure enough they come to blows, but we were also interested in: Can we basically lock them up in a situation where they're equally armed and equally matched — and not only are they trying to beat the crap out of each other - but forced into a situation where they have to talk to each other? And so we play that out... Anything's possible on this show. We are a show that takes place in a very dangerous world and there are high body counts. We've always said from the beginning — and to their credit, Bad Robot and the network have always been supportive of it — is we have to prove over and over again that this is a dangerous world, which means no one in our principal cast can be truly safe. We keep that tension alive.&quot;</blockquote>

<h4>Arrow</h4>
<p>Executive producer Andrew Kreisberg explains why this week's episode is just as much a season finale as next week's actual finale:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;For us, episode 22, in a way, is the season finale and episode 23 is the feature film that gets released over the summer. [Episode] 22 would be the finale on any other series and 23 would take it to a whole different level. It's bigger, we spent more time on it, we had additional shooting days, we shot on old Watchmen sets, we spent a lot more money on it, so it feels bigger and epic and it almost feels like a big summer movie. In the comic books, Merlyn is his greatest nemesis. He's the Joker to Green Arrow's Batman. So it felt natural and right that it should come down to the two of them. But it's not just a fisticuffs. There are a lot of emotions tied up in their relationship.&quot;</blockquote>
