And weirdly, it was an episode about grief and dealing with death. The message? Maybe that learning to love absurdity is the only way to live with death.</p>
<p>This episode was one of those nutso outings that's almost impossible to summarize without writing a freaking book. But in a nutshell, Bonnie drops &quot;the veil&quot; to the Other Side, bringing back all of the dead supernatural creatures from (basically) Purgatory — while at the same time, Elena is realizing that turning on her emotions wasn't enough. She has to start to process her grief over Jeremy's death. These two plotlines intersect in a way that's actually pretty intricate and unpredictable — and by the time the resurrected Jeremy runs into Elena, she's already gone through about 327 stages of grief.</p>
<p>Stefan tries to tell Elena that loss is part of being a vampire — if you live for hundreds of years, you're going to watch a lot of people die, and it's never going to stop hurting. But you have to confront your grief, and work through it, and so on. To which Elena responds by punching Stefan out.</p>
<p>Elena's plan for avoiding coping with the death of Jeremy is to keep focusing on her revenge against Katherine, but she happens to get the drop on Katherine at the exact moment when Katherine is tied magically to Bonnie — and anything that happens to Katherine happens to Bonnie, too.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, everybody supernatural who died in MysticFalls (except Aunt Jenna?) is back and processing their feelings about being dead — Kol wants revenge on Elena, Jeremy wants to protect Elena but takes his time, Alaric wants to drink with Damon to celebrate no longer having to scowl at <em>Cult</em> members, Lexie wants to laugh with Stefan, and Grams wants to tell Bonnie for the one-millionth time that Bonnie is powerful enough to do whatever she wants, except that she can't do anything she wants to do because she's not powerful enough. (It's complicated.)</p>
<p>It all culminates in Bonnie finally putting the kibosh on Silas, without us ever learning what Silas really looks like or what his deal is. And Bonnie telling Elena that it's okay that Elena tried to kill her, because &quot;you weren't yourself,&quot; and Bonnie wasn't herself for a long stretch of time either — but then Bonnie immediately goes and does the dumbest possible thing, trying to  resurrect Jeremy permanently. So is Bonnie still not herself? Or is her self just kind of a lunatic? In any case, it leads to not just Jeremy, but all the mean vampire hunters, being back for good.</p>
<p>Oh, and Bonnie is apparently dead — although this episode proves that's not always the most meaningful line of demarcation on this show, and there will probably be 20 more twists regarding Bonnie next week.</p>
<p>The most interesting bits of the episode, though, might involve Matt and Rebekah. Rebekah is still being the nice girl, even rescuing Caroline from being forced to keep cutting herself (love the slap and the &quot;Bitch!&quot; in response). And Rebekah seems not even to protest when Kol points out that she only mourned him for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Matt is trying hard to be helpful to all and sundry, as usual, but he gets a shoulder-full of broken glass, courtesy of Kol. And Rebekah offers to heal him, the quick and easy way, with her blood — but Matt says people in this town have a nasty habit of becoming vampires, and he wants to graduate high school as a human. But the only way that would become a factor is if Matt is killed while Rebekah's blood is in his system — meaning that Matt is saying he'd rather die than become another one of these vampires.</p>
<p>In an episode that's crammed full of people dying, coming back from the dead, coping with the death of loved ones, trying to kill each other, and obsessing about the downside of immortality — to the point where, yes, it does start to seem a bit absurd — Matt's simple declaration that he's willing to die to keep his humanity almost gets lost in all the noise. But instead, it stands out, as the most profound embrace of death in the episode, by one of the few people on the show who's technically still alive.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"tv recap";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"vampire diaries";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"television";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"vampires";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sat, 11 May 2013 00:30:47 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"500634889";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Charlie Jane Anders";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"What&#039;s the most stylish dystopia of all time?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://io9.com/whats-the-most-stylish-dystopia-of-all-time-500524899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:709:"<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18naaviwbxq86png/ku-xlarge.png" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p class="first-text">Everybody knows that dystopias have the best fashions and the coolest designs.

world's greatest architectural wonders don't feature straight vertical lines or cool curving silhouettes — there are leaning towers all over the world. Some of them were built that way, and some have just started to lean over time. Here are some of the most eye-popping photos.</p>

<h3>The Church of Our Dear Lady at the Mountain (or Upper Church / Oberkirche), Bad Frankenhausen, Germany</h3>
<p>The wonderful church was built in 1382, but in the 17th century its tower started to tilt, due to the growing sinkholes of nearby salt mines. Pictured above.</p>

<h3>Torre Delle Milizie, Rome, Italy</h3>
<p class="has-media media-640"><em><img height="426" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9cgz7x44dejpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></em></p>
<p>The original height of the tower is uncertain, but after a big earthquake in 1348, the top two floors were demolished, and now it's 160 ft (50 m) high. This earthquake caused the slight tilting of the structure.</p>

<h3>The leaning towers of Venice, Italy</h3>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="838" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9zavjfnwpqjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p><strong>Chiesa di San Giorgio dei Greci</strong></p>
<p>Greek Orthodox worship was not permitted in Venice for centuries, but from the 16th Century the local Greek community gained the rights to build a confraternity and a church with a belltower. The tower was completed in 1592 — and now it leans to the west.</p>

<h3><strong>Chiesa di San Martino, Burano</strong></h3>
<p class="has-media media-640"><strong><img height="428" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9cgz82kbiqjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></strong></p>
<h3><strong><strong>Basilica di San Pietro di Castello</strong><br/></strong></h3>
<p>This church was estabilished by bishop Saint Magnus in the 7th Century, but the present building was built at the end of the 16th and in the first three decades of the 17th century. It contains the Throne of St Peter, a 13th century seat cut from a funeral stone and inscribed with words from the Koran.</p>

<h3>The Leaning Tower of Suurhusen, Germany</h3>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="473" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9cgv9vjutrjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p>The 89.8 ft (27.37 m) high tower was made of brick around 1450, and currently leans at an angle of 5.1939 degrees. The reason for the tilt? The whole tower is standing on oak tree trunks which were preserved by groundwater, but in the 19th century the land was drained and it made the wood rot. This is the most slanted tower in the entire world.</p>

<h3>Söyembikä Tower, Kazan, Republic of Tatarstan, Russia</h3>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="767" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9kvwfw8ab1jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p>The architectural symbol of the Tatar capital was probably built in the first half of the 16th century, but several scholars date its construction to the late 17th or early 18th centuries. Hundred years ago its inclination was estimated at 76 in (194 cm). Some stabilization methods were used in the 1930s and 1990s, but the leaning is still visible.</p>

<h3>St. Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, United Kingdom</h3>

<p>The church has a twisted spire, added to the church in 1362. It is both twisted and leaning, twisting 45 degrees and leaning 9ft 6 in (2.9 m) from its true centre. This interesting shape was caused by the heating of the lead that covers the spire.</p>

<h3>Greyfriars Tower, King's Lynn, West Norfolk, United Kingdom</h3>

<p>The only remaining part of the Franciscan monastery, the 92 ft (28 m) high tower was a useful seamark for centuries. As its worst, the lean was 2 ft 2 in (67.5 cm) — which is just over 1 degree — but seven years ago, the slant was corrected.<em> (via<a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1447577" target="_blank"> Geograph/Richard Humphrey</a>)</em></p>
<h3>Leaning Temple of Huma, India</h3>

<p>The only leaning temple in the world is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The main structure was built in the late 17th century, but some others were added in the 1770s and 1780s.</p>

<p>It was originally a water tower built in the late 19th century, but later it was used as a watchtower during the Japanese occupation of the country in 1941. It looks like an 8 storey building, but on the inside it is actually divided into three stories.</p>

<p>The 946-year-old pagoda (it was built in 1079) stands on a hillside just 25 miles outside Shanghai. It leans at a 6.87 degree angle.</p>

<p>Probably this small, (32 ft 9 in or 10 m high) tower from brick and stone tower is the world's first leaning tower — and the most tilted.</p>

<h3>Tower of Nevyansk, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia</h3>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="430" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9vigjgnr6mjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p>The 18th Century tower's purpose isn't really clear: the historians are not sure that it was a watchtower, a belltower, a place to create counterfeit money, or just a symbolic tower to embody the might of the funder Demidov family. The height of the building is 189 ft (57.5 m) and it's deviation is 7 ft 3 in (2.2 m).</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="430" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9vh56wa4qijpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p>That's not the only mystery in the tower's history: there is a square acoustic room where if a person stands in one corner, he or she can whisper anything to another person in the opposite corner. The tower's tented room was the first cast iron cupola ín the world, hundred years before the reconstruction of the Mainz Cathedral in Germany and the workers used reinforced concrete, 130 years before a Parisian gardener discovered it in the 1860s.</p>

<p>The Gothic Protestant church was founded as a Roman Catholic St. Bartholomew's Church in 1246, but after the Protestant Reformation it was one of the churches that were transformed.</p>

<h3>The Two Towers of Bologna, Italy</h3>

<p>The landmarks of the Italian city from the 12th and the 13th Century weren't the only high structures of the city in their times: there were up to 180 of them.</p>
<p>Now only fewer than twenty can still be seen. The Asinelli (97 m or 318 ft 2 in) and the Garisenda (48 m or 157 ft 5 in) are the most famous.</p>

<p>And finally, the most famous example of a leaning tower. This campanile (freestanding bell tower) leaned at an angle of 5.5 degrees, but after the restoration work between 1990 and 2001, now it leans at about 3.99 degrees. It means that the top of the tower is displaced horizontally almost 3.9 meters (12 ft 10 in) from where it would be if the structure were perfectly vertical. The construction of the 183.3 ft (55.86 m)  tower took almost 200 years (1173-1372).</p>
<p>The tower has been leaning since shortly after its initial construction in 1173, due to unstable substrate soils.</p>

<p>Details are scarce, but the car was the creation of a Florida company, and was called a &quot;road worthy tester.&quot; The <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/flying-car-crashes-near-school-in-vernon-bc/article11856807/?cmpid=rss1&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">crash occurred around 9 AM this morning</a> near a school in British Columbia.</p>

<p>The occupants were not seriously injured and are expected to make a full recovery. </p>
<p>It doesn't sound like the company that built the car is <a href="http://jalopnik.com/tag/terrafugia">Terrafugia</a>, the Massachusetts based startup that wants everyone to take to the air. These are the sort of things we may have to deal with.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em> The car that crashed is <a href="http://mavericklsa.com/" target="_blank">called a Maverick</a> (thanks to commenter <a href="http://demon-xanth.kinja.com/" target="_blank">Demon-Xanth</a> for the tip), built by Florida based Maverick LSA. The car uses a parachute and a propeller to fly. I spoke with Troy at Maverick, and he said they are still trying to find out what happened and that they just found out, but that everyone in the crash will be ok.</p>
<p>I asked Troy to keep us updated on what happened, and he told me &quot;that's too much effort.&quot; Amazing they don't sell more of them! Looks like I'll be calling him back a few times.</p>
<p><a href="http://bc.ctvnews.ca/" target="_blank">CTV News</a> reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/CTV_Curtis" target="_blank">Curtis Allen</a> was on the scene, he relayed this account to us:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>From what I know, pilot Ray Sebring designed the car to be used in 3rd world countries for missionaries. The idea is when the road ends, they put up the &quot;Wing&quot; and fly until there is road again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>He took off this morning in Vernon British Columbia and crashed around 8:45am PDST. He was meters away from an elementary school that was going to have a sports day that morning. He crashed into the schools fence, which may have saved his life, and came to rest a few feet away at the base of some trees. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>He's okay, as is his passenger. I've heard he put his teeth through his lips.</div>

A terrella is not much more than a magnet that's been carved into a ball, but it has helped scientists both visualize and prove points about the Earth and its magnetic field.  </p>
<p>The first terrella was carved back in Elizabethan times, when people wanted to know what the movement of a magnet on a compass indicated about the Earth.  William Gilbert - Royal doctor and earliest known incarnation of Bill Nye the Science Guy - thought it was because the Earth was a huge magnet, and made a magnetized mini-Earth to show that he was right.  A compass that moved over the so-called terrella moved the way a compass did over the surface of the Earth. </p>
<p>The picture up top is a recreation of a series of experiments done in the late 1800s and early 1900s, by Kristian Birkeland, attempting to explain the phenomenon behind the polar aurora.  Birkeland, instead of carving his terrella directly out of a magnet, put an electromagnetic coil inside a metal sphere.  He then put the sphere in a vacuum chamber and released a just a bit of gas between it and the metal plates he suspended it between.  The gas mimicked the Earth's atmosphere.  When he shot electrons at the terrella - imitating the solar wind - the magnetic field of the terrella steered the electrons towards the poles, where they excited the gas molecules until they glowed.  Anyone could see the similarities between this and the Northern Lights.</p>
<p>Birkeland tried other experiments as well, attempting to model phenomena such as sunspots and solar flares, and their effects on Earth.  He was not as successful with this as he was with the auroras.  When computers came along, no one needed the poor terrella anymore.  It's still pretty, though.</p>

<p><strong>Peter Dinklage: Underdog</strong></p>
<p>Dinklage plays the evil Simon Bar Sinister in this <a href="http://io9.com/5804896/10-greatest-superhero-dogs">canine superhero</a><inset id="5804896"></inset> movie. Here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4jxCzFMGEs" target="_blank">one interview</a> with him about it. He also <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/peter-dinklage,2065/" target="_blank">talked to the AV Club about the film</a>, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hard working with animals, I've got to say. We did the same thing with Underdog. Your pockets are filled with bacon, there's meat dangling above your head so the dog looks like it's looking in your eyes, there are trainers standing by who have to shout commands before you say your lines. It's slow going. That's what they say: &quot;Don't work with children or animals.&quot; I've done a couple of movies where I've done both, and, especially with the animals, it's slow going. But the end result has worked out somehow.</p>

<p>This was a tough one — Bean has been in so many genre classics, including a certain massive fantasy trilogy and two <em>Silent Hill</em> films. But in terms of wacky or off-beat roles, it came down to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5paBdZiLhqQ" target="_blank">the evil doctor in Michael Bay's The Island</a>, or Zeus in the <em>Percy Jackson</em> films. And Zeus wins, partly because it's such a dementedly over the top franchise. And partly because Bean is the only one of the Greek gods from the first movie to return for the second. Here's a glimpse of him wearing his muscley breastplate and brandishing his big lightning bolt.</p>

In a tense, multi-layered episode, we witness the transformation of two great minds: one belongs to the mad hacker Finch, and the other to his AI creation, the Machine.</p>
<p> Spoilers ahead!</p>
<p> At this point in the show, we've been living with the mystery of both minds for quite a while. We know that Finch is a crime-stopping vigilante who uses his hacker powers to subvert surveillance systems for great justice. His ace-in-the-hole, however, is the Machine — a murkily-defined piece of technology that does insanely complex datamining to predict crimes before they happen.</p>

<p>Though he's a loner who has faked his own death, Finch can't seem to stop reaching out to other ronins like himself, to enlist their aid in preventing those crimes. The Machine Gang includes ex-CIA ninja Reese, the ex-military, highly ethical cop Carter, the reformed dirty cop Fusco, and now the ex-intelligence officer Shaw. He's even started to work (reluctantly) with his hacker nemesis Root, who is one of the only people on the planet who truly understands what the Machine represents.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the Machine. It's the show's greatest unknown, and its most overtly science fictional character. That's right — I said character. Because in this episode, &quot;God Mode,&quot; we at last have confirmation that the Machine is an artificial intelligence. It's a human-equivalent entity with a sense of self-preservation, loyalty, and ultimately (as we discover) self-determination too.</p>

<p>The question in last night's episode was what turned Finch and the Machine into the beings they are today. We discover Finch's origins in a series of flashbacks that take us right to the heart of Person of Interest's dark, satirical view of how the US intelligence community actually works. It turns out that back in 2010, Finch's old business partner and best friend Ingram was about to tell the media about the Machine. Ingram couldn't live with the fact that they'd sold this world-changing device to the government — and that the government was only using it to track down terrorists. Any time the Machine came up with future crimes related to civilians, the government deemed them &quot;irrelevant&quot; and deleted them.</p>

<p>So Ingram had secretly been siphoning the irrelevant data off the Machine, and trying to prevent those crimes himself. And now, in his biggest act of subversion yet, he was going to go public with what he'd done. Finch, for his part, wasn't crazy about this idea. In this episode and last week's, we learned that Finch had committed some pretty serious felonies and was living under an assumed name (which means we don't actually know Finch's real name yet). Ingram kept Finch's involvement with the Machine project completely secret from the government, because they'd never have agreed to work with a felon — even a reformed one.</p>

<p>After a long, intense talk with Ingram, Finch finally decided to go along with his friend's plan to go public. But just as he was walking toward their rendezvous with a journalist, a car bomb went off — killing Ingram and injuring Finch (hence, his limp). Of course, it was a giant setup. The intelligence guy who runs the government Machine project kidnapped some poor guy from the Middle East, strapped him into a car full of explosives, and set it off. That way, the government is able blame the whole thing on terrorists, and keep their Machine safe.</p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="168" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9wvqcf2lv3jpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>Realizing this, Finch hauls himself out of his hospital bed, dribbling blood, and hides when his fiancee comes to find him. Because he wasn't identified by the hospital yet, she believes he's dead. That's when his afterlife as a vigilante begins. He decides to continue Ingram's project and become a ghost.</p>
<p>In the world of<em> Person of Interest</em>, the US government kills its own people almost as often as they stop terrorism with the Machine. Maybe even more often.  </p>
<p>And this is the world that gave birth to the Machine. That can't possibly be a good thing — can it? Luckily, the Machine was programmed by our subversive hacker hero, so it's not particularly crazy about how the intelligence community is acting either. As the episode begins, the Machine has gone into &quot;seeking admin&quot; mode, and Finch has handed off admin access to both Root and Reese. That means that the Machine is no longer this remote entity — it's actually talking to our heroes, through their earbuds. &quot;Can you hear me now?&quot; it asks Root, in an audio collage of voices taken from the internet. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; she answers with a terrifying smile.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="361" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9wvqc6nqp2jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p>This leads to one of the most awesome Machine POV scenes we've had in the series yet, as the Machine guides Reese and Root through a gunfight with government intelligence guys who want to take back control of the Machine. The New York Public Library becomes a videogame grid of possible ballistic trajectories, with the Machine anticipating each adversaries' move and telling Reese and Root which directions they should shoot. It may not look as fancy as the special effects in <em>Minority Report</em>, but the ideas here just pop like crazy. You never doubt that you're in the middle of a seriously great scifi action scene.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="180" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9wvuac3mxyjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p>Once they've escaped, Reese, Shaw, Root and Finch decide their next move should be to find where the Machine is physically located. Unfortunately, Finch has programmed the Machine not to reveal its location, so they have to jump through a lot of hoops and dodge a lot of bullets to find it. But when they finally reach the hardened fake nuclear facility where the Machine was supposed to be — it's GONE.</p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="215" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n9wvuagif0tjpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>They stand in a vast, empty space, wondering where the hell the Machine has gone. But Finch comes in to explain. The Machine has moved itself. It faked a bunch of emails, phone calls, and move requests and has now stashed all its servers in hidden locations all over the country — maybe all over the world. It has become a distributed, networked intelligence that fights for its own survival and sovereign control over its destiny. It is, for all intents and purposes, a living being.</p>

<p>Though Finch has been insisting that the Machine is &quot;just&quot; a machine, he smiles like a proud parent when he tells the gang that the Machine has just liberated itself and now answers to no one. Now it's up to the Machine to decide how it wants to run its life. Does it want to continue helping humans fight crime, or does it want to do some obscure thing that only makes sense to an AI? We just don't know.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the intelligence guy who headed the now-borked Machine program in the government is going down. One of his henchmen gets a call from somebody only referred to as &quot;ma'am,&quot; and she gives the kill order. &quot;Fair enough,&quot; he says, in what have to be among the best last words ever, as the henchman takes him out. Who knows what's going to happen to &quot;Northern Lights,&quot; the government name for the Machine?</p>

<p>Well, the Machine does. When we see through the Machine's eyes, it always tagged Northern Lights operatives with blue boxes around their faces, while Finch and the Machine Gang were tagged in yellow. Now, both groups are tagged in yellow. Interesting. And the Machine is still giving out the social security numbers of endangered people. So, at least for now, it's still interested in helping prevent crime. And as the episode ends, it's still talking into Root's earbud. So it's interested in some other stuff too. </p>

<p>As we jumped back and forth in the timeline during this episode, I found myself musing about how the Machine's internal timeline goes to 2017. What does that mean? The show might be entirely comprised of flashbacks in the database of the 2017 version of the Machine. Or perhaps the Machine's prediction horizon is four years long, so it's filling in potential future events as it lives through 2013. This kind of narrative tease is exactly what makes this show so rewarding. </p>

<p>Earlier I compared Person of Interest to Max Headroom. They have a lot in common: both are about using technology to bring justice to a corrupt world, and both center around a crucial AI figure. The difference is that Max Headroom was about combatting abusive corporate power with investigative journalism, while POI takes aim at government abuses by using the tools of that government against it — including surveillance technology and lethal violence. </p>

<p>Both shows are about the future of political subversion.</p>

<p>Both also have a really weird sense of humor.  You've probably seen the Max Headroom monologues — that show's AI was known for jibber-jabbering snarkily about the absurdities of television culture, among other things. Person of Interest doesn't have a lot of funny lines, but it's got great, oddball comic timing. Take, for example, this scene where Reese and Shaw are on their way to a major plot point when the Machine interrupts them with an SMS about a person they need to save nearby. They race up to a wedding in their shiny car, see a guy who is about to shoot the bride and groom, take him out and zoom away.</p>

<p class="has-media media-640"><a href="http://www.viddler.com/v/239a100d" target="_blank"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe scrolling="no" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitAllowFullScreen="webkitAllowFullScreen" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640" src="http://www.viddler.com/embed/239a100d/?f=1&amp;autoplay=false&amp;player=mini&amp;disablebranding=0" id="viddler-239a100d"></iframe></span></a></p>

<p>It's basically wry comic book humor, translated beautifully to the small screen.</p>

<p>Despite the humor, however, <em>Person of Interest</em> is firmly a part of the cyber-noir genre that William Gibson explored in novels like <em>Pattern Recognition</em> and <em>Spook Country</em>, which were set in a kind of blurry present day or near past, but could just as easily have been the near future. It's a show that deals with some weighty political issues, but isn't afraid to have fun. It's also not afraid to give us heroes with what <a href="http://io9.com/person-of-interests-nolan-we-have-not-lost-our-blood-499013695">show creator Jonathan Nolan called &quot;bloodlust.&quot;</a><inset id="499013695"></inset> We're not in Batman's world, where the vigilante tries not to kill anybody.

Fritz Haber, a Nobel Prize winner, went from creating chemical weapons to panning for gold in the ocean. But could this have worked?</p>

<p><strong>The Shadow of World War I</strong></p>
<p>In wartime, what is the duty of an eminent scientist? Fritz Haber, an expert on <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1918/haber-bio.html" target="_blank">electrochemistry</a> and gaseous chemical interactions, felt an intense desire to serve the German cause during World War I. In doing so, Haber left behind a legacy that would overshadow his immense civilian contributions; contributions to science from which humanity continues to reap the rewards.</p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="344" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n8yjvcfmj7hjpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p>
<p>During World War I, Haber aided in the weaponization of chlorine gas and in the creation of several other weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Haber's wartime contribution extended outside of the laboratory doors —  the scientist often journeyed to the battlefield in order to oversee the dispersal of the chemical agents. Chemical weapons became a key component of the German arsenal in the early 20th Century, weapons that could destroy hundreds of entrenched and unprotected enemy soldiers within minutes.</p>
<p>Haber’s first wife, Clara Immerwahr, also held a Ph.D. in Chemistry and aided the German war machine. On the eve of Germany’s first field use of chemical weapons, however, Clara committed <a href="http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/immerwahr-clara" target="_blank">suicide</a> out of guilt stemming from Haber's chemical weapons work and their marital difficulties.</p>
<p>Haber’s extensive participation in World War I did not harm his Nobel Prize chances, with a fifty-year-old Haber winning the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work leading to the synthesis of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process. Humanity continues to reap the benefits of his ammonia research, as industrial use of the Haber-Bosch process provides for the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1918/haber-bio.html" target="_blank">majority</a> of the world's fertilizer.</p>
<p>Haber did not receive the 1918 Nobel Prize until 1919, shortly after Germany’s defeat in World War I. The acclaimed scientist never faced trial for war crimes,thanks to Britain and France also using chemical weapons widely during the war.</p>
<p><strong>Gold from Seawater?</strong></p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="204" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n98bshw499xjpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p>
<p>After World War I, the 1919 Treaty of Versailles required that Germany pay between <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/dluebke/Germany342/Reparations.html" target="_blank">50 and 132 billion</a> German gold marks to France, Britain, and Russia. This was a huge blow to a war-torn economy — the upper end of that figure comes close to half a trillion dollars, when adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>Playing to his nationalistic side, Haber sought a process by which to extract tiny amounts of gold from seawater. Seawater contains a wellspring of elements. Sodium, chloride, magnesium, potassium are present in large amounts, while an element as obscure as uranium is present in trace amounts. Haber believed the gold within the world's oceans could be withdrawn and accumulated, to create a &quot;free&quot; source of money for Germany.</p>
<p>This bizarre scheme appeared financially viable at first.  Haber initially estimated that <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/do53ri.html" target="_blank">sixty-five miligrams</a> of gold could extracted from a metric ton of seawater.</p>
<p>To extract gold, Haber planned to separate the acquired seawater using massive centrifuges and his expertise in electrochemistry. Concentrating the gold would consume a phenomenal amount of energy, but at the estimated acquisition rate, an energy cost that would leave Germany with a large profit margin.</p>
<p>On Haber's recommendation, Germany initiated a two-year journey to survey the amount of gold in bodies of water across the world in 1925. In time, Haber found an error in his initial calculations, with the actual amount of gold within seawater <a href="http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/history/h3.epl" target="_blank">overestimated</a> by a factor of one-thousand.</p>
<p>And that, in turn, meant the effort would not be worthwhile. The value of the gold garnered by the process would would not cover the cost of the energy necessary for extraction. Dr. Haber took the failure of the gold-from-the-sea effort to heart, believing that he should have caught the error in his initial projections.</p>
<p>In 1933, Haber left Germany under duress, due to his Jewish heritage although he had converted to Lutheranism early in life. He died in 1934 from cardiovascular failure, leaving behind a legacy that merges the deaths of thousands in World War I with his Nobel Prize-winning peacetime work, which laid the foundation for modern agriculture.</p>

The Sun's corona, however, remains very much in view – a roiling wreath of spellbinding atmospheric activity.</p>
<p>The image above was captured by Czech photographer <a href="http://www.zam.fme.vutbr.cz/~druck/Eclipse/Ecl2009e/0-info.htm" target="_blank">Miloslav Druckmüller</a> on July 22, 2009, when the Moon blocked our star from view for a whopping 6 minutes and 39 seconds. It was, and will remain, the longest total solar eclipse of the 21st century. From the Enewetak Radiological Observatory on the Marshall Islands – an archipelago in the northern Pacific Ocean – Druckmüller managed to capture a series of images of our Moon in transit,  with the express purpose of photographing not just the Sun's blockage, but the extent and shape of its corona.  Writes Druckmüller on his blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expedition to Enewetak was a part of the Shadow-tracking Expedition project, which is being organized by me and my daughter Hana at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic. The goal of the &quot;Shadow-tracking expedition&quot; project is to obtain observing data from various places during the total solar eclipse, which enables to study changes in the solar corona. The second observing place was in Suzhou in China. The observing conditions at our observing place at Enewetak enabled us to realize majority of our plans. Unfortunately, in Suzhou it was raining during the eclipse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The images you see here are composites, assembled from dozens of photographs taken with multiple lenses and a variety of exposure settings to bring the Sun's corona into view. </p>

<p>Gorgeous, right? Here's what blows our mind: according to Druckmüller, all of the observers in his group &quot;group stated that it was the weakest corona they had ever seen.&quot; Nonetheless, he was able to capture images like this one, which show the Sun's corona extending outward to distances of 6 solar radii:</p>

It's not surprising.  N-rays don't exist.  And yet there are multiple independently published papers claiming that they do.  Learn how one scientist's vision infected nearly everyone around him.</p>
<p>Rene Blondlot was not stupid.  He'd made an early measurement of the speed of radio waves, worked on a Kerr cell, and generally dominated the study of electromagnetism.  And so, when he announced in 1903 that he'd discovered something called n-rays, the world took notice.  He played by the rules, too, giving others all the details on how to make n-rays appear.  Take an energy source and shine it onto a thread treated with calcium sulfide.  Let the light coming from that thread shine through a prism, and the n-rays should be visible as faint lines on a spectroscope.</p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="398" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n37lkm7vv6ygif/ku-medium.gif" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p>
<p>Blondlot's openness payed off.  Over the next three years, papers poured in detailing the strange properties of the n-rays.  Some people count the number of reputable papers as thirty, but some say there were as many as three hundred, from scientific institutions around the world.  Many were published in journals.  N-rays emanated from all kinds of sources, but, for some reason, not green wood or metal covered in chloroform.  They didn't seem to increase with the amount of the material used.  They did, however, seem to increase with the 'sentience' of the material.  In other words, people created more of them than animals and animals more than inanimate objects.  <br/><br/>These last claims provoked some skepticism, as did the fact that many institutions couldn't find them, no matter how carefully they followed Blondlot's instructions.  Johns Hopkins sent another well-known physicist, Robert Wood, up to Blondlot to see what the discrepancy was.  Blondlot was happy to show Wood the n-rays in his spectroscope.  Wood still couldn't see them.  Eventually, it was decided that Wood might see them if the lights were off in the lab.  When Blondlot turned the lights off, Wood removed the prism from Blondlot's apparatus.  Blondlot could still see the n-rays.  The rest of the world, obviously, hasn't seen them since.<br/><br/>And yet many people saw them, once upon a time.  Scores of papers were published, with entire teams seeing the strange phenomenon, for years.  Up to several hundred people confirmed Blondlot's findings in a field supposedly devoted to skeptical inquiry - or at least at least bloodthirsty competition.  Why did so many people see Blondlot's results, when they would have gained more by debunking them?  There's no telling what, exactly, caused people to react the way they did.  <br/><br/>If you see any n-rays now, do let us know, though. <br/><br/>Via <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/27757473?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102182591701" target="_blank">JStor</a>, <a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-10-13/" target="_blank">eSkeptic</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"physics";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hoaxes";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"n-rays";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"rene blondlot";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"science";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 10 May 2013 19:40:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"497037919";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Esther Inglis-Arkell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"Browncoats Assemble: ABC really did pick up Joss Whedon&#039;s SHIELD!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://io9.com/its-official-abc-has-picked-up-joss-whedons-s-h-i-e-499817421";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11215:"<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="447" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18naq1ct6rhh6jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p class="first-text">ABC has announced that they'll be picking up Joss Whedon's <em>Agents of SHIELD. </em>And already, the first bit of teaser footage has leaked and been hastily scrubbed from the internet. Here's what we saw — plus a bunch of other upcoming TV shows, including Adult Swim's frat-boy ghost comedy. <strong>UPDATE: NOW it's official!<br/></strong></p>
<h2>ABC</h2>
<p><em><strong>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: </strong></em><strong>CONFIRMED</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/09/its-official-joss-whedon-and-marvels-agents-of-shield-ordered-to-series-by-abc" target="_blank">IGN</a> has just confirmed that ABC is 100% picking up <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. </em>Yesterday, a bit of viral video <a href="http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-watch-abc-teases-hulk-series-62575/" target="_blank">turned up online</a> — some surveillance-type footage, where an evil organization named Rising Tide is looking through a viewfinder trying to find... the Hulk. It's all very high tech, Hollywood-style, and the Hulk is actually outlined with some sort of wacky identification software. And here it is:</p>

<p>Anyone else find it hilarious that the Hulk is in the first bit of teaser footage after <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/05/09/s-h-i-e-l-d-series-order/" target="_blank">Whedon said he wouldn't?</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Sorry it seems that the internet reports have jumped the gun. We just spoke to an ABC spokesperson on the phone, who would only confirm that the series is &quot;likely&quot; to be picked up. And that they aren't sure when the news will be made official. </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> According to <a href="https://twitter.com/AgentsofSHIELD/status/333014585353306113/photo/1" target="_blank">a tweet</a> from the apparently official Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. account and <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/417077/abc-scoop-joss-whedon-s-marvel-s-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-ordered-to-series?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-topstories&amp;utm_source=eonline&amp;utm_medium=rssfeeds&amp;utm_campaign=rss_topstories" target="_blank">E! Online</a>, this time it really is official: the show has been picked up for the fall season. And they released the shiny cast photo which you can see up top. And a preview for the series will be shown during Sunday's <em>Once Upon a Time</em> finale.  And here's a new logo!</p>

<p>But that's not all — there are also some new shows on Adult Swim and The CW:</p>

<h2>Adult Swim</h2>
<p>Adult Swim just released a massive press release, stuffed with new TV pilots and tons of specials — including the announcement that there will be another <em>Robot Chicken</em> DC Comics special and a <em>Metalocalypse</em> special. But honestly we're just so excited for Dan Harmon's animated series and this other series about ghosts. </p>

<p><em><strong>Rick And Morty</strong></em><strong>: CONFIRMED </strong></p>
<p>After being booted from <em>Community</em>, show runner and <a href="http://io9.com/5964729/watch-dan-harmons-surprisingly-inspirational-keynote-speech-on-the-death-of-television">ranting genius</a><inset id="5964729"></inset> Dan Harmon chose to team up with Justin Roiland and go make their own damn show on Adult Swim, titled Rick and  Morty. This is the only information we have on the series, other than the fact that we so hungry for a Harmon fix, after this dismal season of <em>Community</em> — we would happily pay for a preview NOW! </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rick and Morty</em> is about a genius inventor grandfather and his less than genius grandson, and the journeys in life they share. From Dan Harmon (<em>Community, Channel 101</em>) and Justin Roiland. Animated half-hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="358" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n985phb3rxnjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p><strong><em>Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell</em>: CONFIRMED</strong></p>
<p>Classic Demon at work sitcom. Hellfire and hilarity to ensue. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new live-action series from Adult Swim is a workplace comedy about Gary, an associate demon, as he attempts to capture souls on earth in order to climb the corporate ladder of the underworld. Gary hopes to advance in Hell, but he may be too stupid, lazy and kind-hearted to realize his dreams of promotion. Meanwhile, Gary’s intern Claude is more talented, more devious and will do whatever it takes to impress Satan. A Williams Street production, the show is created and directed by Dave Willis<em> </em><em>(Squidbillies, Aqua Teen Hunger Force) </em>and Casper Kelly<em> (Squidbillies, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, Stroker &amp; Hoop). </em> The series is currently presenting premiere episodes on Thursday nights at Midnight ET/PT on Adult Swim. Live-action quarter-hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>King Star King: CONFIRMED </strong></p>
<p>You had us at Punk Rock He-Man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>King Star King</em> features a punk rock, modern day he-man who falls from the realm of the gods to land as a fry cook in a slummy waffle joint. King Star King must regain his memory to defeat the evil (and adorable) Spring Bunny and rescue his love, the megababe Princess Snow White. Only then will King Star King regain his rightful place in the heavens. From artist JJ Villard (<em>Monsters Vs. Aliens</em>). Animated quarter-hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ghostbags: CONFIRMED</strong></p>
<p>And now <em>Ghostbags</em>, quite possibly the most creative concept we've ever read about. The show is about the dead spirits of dickhead frat guys. It's only a half our animation but we're already gunning for an undead Sorority Girl spinoff. Also the folks behind <em>Eastbound and Down</em> are behind this, so expect some quality self important humor. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> These three frat guys were douchebags while they lived, but now that they've died in a horrible car accident, absolutely nothing has changed. Created by Hayes Davenport (<em>Eastbound and Down</em>) and Guy Endore-Kaiser (<em>Allen Gregory</em>). </p>

<p><strong><em>Team Unicorn</em>: CONFIRMED</strong></p>
<p>Then there's Team Unicorn, which will probably be something like this music video they made a few years ago. It kind of speaks for itself. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Team Unicorn</em> is a modern send-up of Saturday morning kids’ shows featuring a team of four sexy, culture-obsessed heroines who present darkly ironic twists on 80's cartoon tropes. From the creators of <em>Robot Chicken</em>. Live action/animation mix, quarter-hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Übermansion: </em>CONFIRMED</strong></p>
<p>And something brighter coming from the Robot Chicken peeps is this cute idea of a putting a bunch of superheroes together in a mansion. Somehow Bryan Cranston is involved. *THUMBS UP*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Stoopid Buddy Stoodios and the creators of <em>Robot Chicken</em>comes <em>Übermansion</em>, a glimpse into the mundane humanity of six superheroes all living in the same mansion. Created by Zeb Wells and Matthew Senreich, executive produced by Wells, Senreich, Seth Green, John Harvatine IV, Eric Towner and Bryan Cranston. Animated quarter-hour.</p>

<h2>The CW</h2>
<p><a href="http://io9.com/new-scifi-tv-shows-from-alfonso-cuaron-and-the-creators-498980519">We predicted</a><inset id="498980519"></inset> that that The CW would pick up both <em>The Tomorrow People</em> and <em>The Hundred</em>, and <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/05/09/cw-sci-fi-shows/" target="_blank">has just confirmed</a> that The CW has given both of those futuristic shows the green light. Hooray! But they've also picked up another science fiction show we didn't see coming, and renewed the underrated <em>Nikita</em>. </p>

<p><strong><em>STAR-CROSSED</em>: CONFIRMED</strong> </p>
<p>Originally called <em>Oxygen,</em> this teen drama promises to bring a little Roswell back to The CW. It's girl meets alien — and then they all get sent to internment camps. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passion and politics threaten the peace and an epic romance ignites between a human girl and an alien boy when he and eight others of his kind (The Orion 9) are integrated into a suburban high school ten years after they and hundreds of others landed on Earth and were immediately consigned to an internment camp where they’ve been imprisoned ever since. Aimee Teagarden, Matt Lanter star.</p>

Or is that Batman, whose Batsuit and nearly limitless supply of gadgets are a constant inspiration?</p>

<p>Over at<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/05/04/iron-man-batman-and-the-innovation-superhero/" target="_blank"> the Washington Post's innovation blog</a>, they were wondering this the other day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But is Iron Man really the superhero of choice for the innovation set?... What about Batman? He’s rich, smart and fueled by an almost singular desire to fight crime, and boy does he have an arsenal of creative tech at his disposal. Granted, Bruce Wayne doesn’t tinker with the technology himself, at least not to the extent Stark does. That damages his chances of unseating Stark as the innovation superhero of choice. But sometimes even financial backers are key to great innovation. Think venture capitalists and angel investors — people with means and a shared passion or common goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whose tech is more inventive? And who's better at problem-solving in a tough spot? And does it matter that Batman doesn't invent all his own gear himself? It's an interesting question to consider.</p>

<p>Created by the datavisualization experts at <a href="http://www.floatingsheep.org/" target="_blank">Floating Sheep</a>, the interactive map was made in response to criticism that a previous map – which plotted the distribution of racial epithets in the wake of Obama's re-election – had arrived at specious conclusions about the relative amount of racist content emanating from Mississippi and Alabama. Via <a href="http://www.floatingsheep.org/" target="_blank">Floating Sheep</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to address [one such criticism] , students at Humboldt State manually read and coded the sentiment of [hundreds of thousands of tweets containing homophobic, racist, or ableist slurs] to determine if the given word was used in a positive, negative or neutral manner. This allowed us to avoid using any algorithmic sentiment analysis or natural language processing, as many algorithms would have simply classified a tweet as ‘negative’ when the word was used in a neutral or positive way. For example the phrase ‘dyke’, while often negative when referring to an individual person, was also used in positive ways (e.g. “dykes on bikes #SFPride”). The students were able to discern which were negative, neutral, or positive. Only those tweets used in an explicitly negative way are included in the map... All together, the students determined over 150,000 geotagged tweets with a hateful slur to be negative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The image up top is the map of all the homophobic tweets deemed hateful. Over at the interactive map, viewers can see similar maps for racist and ableist tweets, and even parse the data to examine the geographic distributions of individual words. The results were compelling. &quot;Even when normalized,&quot; write the researchers, &quot;many of the slurs included in our analysis display little meaningful spatial distribution&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, tweets referencing ‘nigger’ are not concentrated in any single place or region in the United States; instead, quite depressingly, there are a number of pockets of concentration that demonstrate heavy usage of the word. In addition to looking at the density of hateful words, we also examined how many unique users were tweeting these words. For example in the Quad Cities (East Iowa) 31 unique Twitter users tweeted the word “nigger” in a hateful way 41 times. There are two likely reasons for higher proportion of such slurs in rural areas: demographic differences and differing social practices with regard to the use of Twitter. We will be testing the clusters of hate speech against the demographic composition of an area in a later phase of this project.</p>

But for two years, researchers at Los Alamos National Labs have been working on something they call <strong>network-centric quantum communications</strong> — and this could usher in the next generation of hyper-secure, scalable, and affordable quantum cryptographic techniques. We spoke to the lead researcher to find out more.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, MIT’s <em>Technology Review</em> published an <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/514581/government-lab-reveals-quantum-internet-operated-continuously-for-over-two-years/" target="_blank">article</a> claiming that a “government lab” has been secretly operating a “quantum internet” for over two years. Several other outlets ran with the story, including <em><a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-05/los-alamos-lab-can-send-literally-perfectly-secure-message" target="_blank">Popular Science</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-05/7/quantum-internet" target="_blank">Wired</a></em>.</p>
<p>But this idea, that a government-sponsored lab was secretly hacking away at the the Holy Grail of internet security, seemed too good to be true. So we contacted the lead researcher, Richard Hughes, to learn more about the project.</p>
<h4>'Not a phrase we used’</h4>
<p>“The MIT article doesn’t accurately characterize what we’ve been doing,” he told io9. “We are not part of the Internet, and that phrase — a quantum internet — is not something we used in our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0305?utm_source=feedly" target="_blank">paper</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Rather, Hughes’s team created a network test bed for doing quantum cryptography over an optical fiber network. They’ve been running it to test their protocols and its performance, with the hope of using it to protect critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid.</p>
<p>“Really, there’s nothing unusual about what’s been going on here for the past two-plus years,” says Hughes. “It’s just that we don’t tend to write papers until we have something interesting to report.”</p>
<p>As for the accusations of secrecy, the <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/index.php" target="_blank">Los Alamos National Labs</a> team was delayed in making their work public because they were filing for multiple patent applications on the technology — of which there were 27 U.S. and foreign patents to secure.</p>
<h4>Quantum crypto</h4>
<p>So, while it may not be a true quantum internet, it’s a system that comes pretty damned close.</p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="377" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n8vvarww3rhjpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p><p> And indeed, UC Berkeley security expert <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~schwartz/" target="_blank">Galina A. Schwartz</a> told me that, while it’s not a true quantum internet, it's a breakthrough that shows we’re well on our way to getting there. “It is exciting,” she told io9, “and it is coming in the future, but not exactly tomorrow.” These devices, she says, are still some way from commercial reality.</p>
<p>By strict definition, a true quantum internet would allow for perfectly secure communications from any point in the network to another. Quantum cryptography would, in theory, make the network secure from wiretaps, eavesdropping, hacking — anything. So long as the one-time pad is kept a secret — a randomly generated and lengthy key that can only be used once — point-to-point communication is impenetrable. Once refined, cryptography of this strength could be used to secure critical infrastructure and protect the electric grid from malicious attacks. </p>
<p>One-time-pads are generated by a process called <a href="http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-10/iss-6/p22.html" target="_blank">quantum key distribution</a> (QKD), and it relies on the spooky power of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to produce shared keys that are only known to two parties, and which are subsequently used to securely exchange messages.</p>
<p>And indeed, it’s this point-to-point limitation that has led some skeptics to believe that a quantum internet is impossible. Others contend that the intense costs and logistical requirements of having to overhaul the world’s IT infrastructure make it a non-starter.</p>
<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="323" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n8w4cbzlt15gif/original.gif" class="transform-original"/></p><p> But this is where Hughes and his team got clever. Knowing that a peer-to-peer quantum internet is impossible (at least by today’s level of comprehension), the Los Alamos lab created <strong>a quantum hub-and-spoke digital communications network</strong>. What’s more, the architecture is potentially Internet compatible; it runs off standard fiber optic cables that connect to off-the-shelf PCs running the Windows operating system.</p>
<p>“We see this attribute as a major innovation over what’s been done before in quantum cryptography networks — and it’s designed from the ground up to be something that’s reasonably evolved over top of what’s already deployed out there,” says Hughes. “We are consistent with conventional optical fiber network architectures and conventional cryptographic trust architectures.”</p>
<h4>Network-centric quantum communications</h4>
<p>The system is a bit clunky, and not peer-to-peer, but it exhibits some fascinating characteristics.</p>
<p>To make it work, the network has a core server computer at the center of it. Then, like the spokes jutting out from the center of a wheel, optical fibers are connected to node computers. These nodes are not connected to each other — but all they share the same hub at the center.</p>
<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="427" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18n8vlnigodvtjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>
<p>For communication to happen, each client node is equipped with a quantum smart card, or QKarD, that’s the size of a door key. The central hub has optical fiber connected into it, along with a small solid-state single photon detector that needs to be cooled below room temperature.</p>
<p>The QKarD allow the nodes to write quantum bits, but they can only read conventional bits. Only the hub is able to both read and write quantum bits. Data travels from each node to the hub along a secure one-time pad enabled connection. So, if node A wants to communicate with node B, node A sends a message to the central hub, which in turn routes the data to node B using secure classical connection enabled by a different one-time pad.</p>
<p>And yes, you guessed correctly: If the security of the hub is compromised, the entire thing falls apart.</p>
<p>“The way the testbed works today is that we have three client devices talking over optical fiber to a server node,” says Hughes.</p>
<p>By concentrating the more expensive and more technologically demanding components in the central server, the team was able to amortize that cost and complexity over all the nodes in the network. Other approaches, on the other hand, require detectors at every node, which is expensive and hard to deploy.</p>
<p>“This is something that’s far beyond what’s been done in the past with quantum cryptography,” Hughes told us. “But what we have is an experimental testbed — one that isn’t in any sense operational.” Last December, the team also demonstrated technology that can secure the control data and commands of the electrical grid against a potential attacker — but again, not in an operational environment.</p>
<h4>’Quantum cryptography is bunk’</h4>
<p>But not everyone is convinced that quantum cryptography represents the future of internet security — at least not immediately.</p>
<p>“Cyber-physical systems operating large scale critical infrastructures such as the electric grid are comprised of products from dozens — even hundreds — of manufacturers,” Schwartz told us. “Will they suddenly switch from non-quantum crypto-solutions to employing quantum cryptography in their products — especially given that malicious intruders focus on attacking the ‘weakest links’ of CPSs?”</p>
<p>In fact, existing security solutions based on conventional cryptography are not at all the ‘weakest link’ of CPS security.</p>
<p>“Manufacturers would rather invest in improving security of the weakest links of their products,” she says. “Many products are known to be notoriously insecure, but still remain in use: proprietary protocols still prevail in electric grid, despite the fact that they are more prone to design failures than public protocols.”</p>
<p>And as Schwartz reminded us, no system with human participants is ‘truly’ secure: “Social engineering will exist 'till humans are extinct.”</p>
<p>We also reached out to <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/" target="_blank">Ross Anderson</a>, a professor at the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory, and author of the paper, “<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7351" target="_blank">Why quantum computing is hard — and quantum cryptography is not provably secure</a>.”</p>
<p>After we brought Hughes’s paper to his attention, he responded in an email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with protecting critical infrastructure isn't that crypto is hard. Crypto is easy; we have protocols like TLS, IPSEC, SSH and Kerberos that are available on pretty well all modern machines. The problem is that a typical power network has a huge diversity of equipment, much of it dating back decades, and it's prohibitively expensive to replace it all with new stuff. As a result, the only feasible way to protect the typical utility is reparameterization; ensuring that the control networks are separated from the Internet using robust firewalls. Cryptography is not the appropriate technology in most cases and even where it is we have cheap simple stuff that works. The authors' hope to sell expensive, flaky quantum crypto into critical infrastructure markets is bizarre. The words &quot;snowflake&quot; and &quot;hell&quot; spring to mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a follow-up email, Anderson put it more succinctly: “No such thing. Quantum crypto is bunk.”</p>
<p>I let Hughes read Anderson’s email, and we talked about it.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t agree with that — and I guess our Department of Energy sponsors don’t agree with that, either, seeing as they’re funding us to do this stuff,” he quipped. “Look, it’s certainly true that there’s a huge installed base of devices out there controlling the grid. And often these things are installed and expected to operate for 20 to 30 years. But they’ve been installed without security on them, so you have an issue of wanting to put in a retrofit to secure it.”</p>
<p>But it’s not true, argues Hughes, that the current state of cryptography can potentially meet the given requirements, many of which have been analyzed by multiple research groups from around the world.</p>
<p>“You just cannot meet the demands for the low latency that’s necessary to control theses things,” he says, “This is why the DOE is interested in funding us, because we can both meet the security and the latency requirements.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, he says, quantum cryptography has an attribute known as forward security — where, if a design weakness is found in the future, and in contrast to present day cryptography, it prevents anything previously done with the hardware from being retroactively vulnerable.</p>
<p>“And that’s absolutely not true with current day public key cryptography,” Hughes told us.</p>
<p>And as for the notion that this is always going to be expensive, and that these initiatives will require a revolution in the existing communications structure, Hughes says that’s just not correct.</p>
<p>“By harnessing these manufacturing techniques that are now being used in integrated photonics, we can get the cost of these transmitter devices down to the couple-of-hundred-dollar range by producing them in large quantities, thus making it reasonable in terms of affordability and deployability. And we can be applied as a retrofit on top of the existing fiber infrastructure — we can deploy on what’s already out there.”</p>
<p>In regards to the claim that everything can be done with pre-existing firewalls, Hughes admits that multiple approaches are warranted, but there are still problems. “There is an active research direction there, but it’s not clear if this is the absolute panacea that Anderson suggested.”</p>
<h4>The future</h4>
<p>Looking ahead, Hughes hopes to see his technology used in the critical infrastructure sector and for securing the electric grid. The potential for hackers to attack the grid, he says, is very real — one that could cripple the economy.</p>
<p>Hughes also sees the potential for securing commands and data, which have tight requirements for latency, often within a few milliseconds to prevent physical damage. It could also work in the financial sector and the burgeoning practice of high speed trading. And indeed, the amount of time it takes to apply cryptography is becoming a significant factor in how fast trades can be executed.</p>
<p>His team is also working on a next generation quantum transmitter QKarD, one that’s much smaller than what they’re currently using. Once miniaturized, these cards could fit inside a mobile phone or tablet device. He envisions a docking station for a handheld device that, in addition to charging the battery, would feed the device’s memory with cryptographic key material that can be shared with a central server in the enterprise. So, when a user undocks the device and carries it around, those secure keys could be used to communicate with friends or colleagues, or other parts of the same network. And it would have all the advantages of quantum security, though without an optical fiber cable.</p>
<p>Wireless quantum-level security in handheld devices? Yes, please.</p>

Next up, doctorates in math and physics. Why the rush? The wheelchair-using teen has a severe form of muscular dystrophy and feels there isn't much time.</p>
<p>Raymond has <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000705.htm" target="_blank">Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</a> — a severe form of muscular dystrophy that worsens quickly. It's a genetic disorder that affects one in every 3,600 male births. Because it causes muscles to waste away, most patients have to start using a wheelchair by the time adolescence kicks in. Breathing difficulties and heart disease set in by the age of 20.</p>

<p>“I don’t anticipate living as long as usual,” Raymond told the <em><a href="http://newswire.uark.edu/articles/21204/eighteen-year-old-finishes-triple-major-will-pursue-doctoral-degrees-in-math-and-physics" target="_blank">University of Arkansas Newswire</a></em>. “In some respects, there is a lot of pressure to get as much done as I can.

I finished my undergraduate economics course work in my freshman year. So as a sophomore I began to take graduate courses.”</p>
<p>Raymond was just 14 when he graduated from high school.</p>
<p>His dad, Hal Water, says his son spends nearly every waking moment outside of class at his studies. Raymond goes to bed after midnight, every night. He doesn’t watch movies or play video games. And he sits at his computer with two desks worth of books which are typically open for 12 to 14 hours each day. “He works constantly.”</p>
<p>Along with his wife, Gail, the family lives on a 193-acre farm in Baxter County where they raise cattle, pigs, donkeys, and horses. Back during high school, Hal and Raymond commuted six hours round trip each weekend. </p>
<p>Raymond graduated from the University of Arkansas' J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences and will now move to the Graduate School as a Distinguished Doctoral Fellow. The program provides a minimum of $30,000 annually for up to four years. Raymond also won a highly competitive $30,000 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship for the forthcoming academic year.</p>

But often, those schemes depend on one lowly minion, and if you just took out that henchperson, the masterplan would never have gotten off the ground. Here are 10 evil schemes that depended on an underling.</p>
<h4>1) The Joker's Escape in <em>The Dark Knight</em></h4>
<p>The Joker runs rings around Batman and the GCPD in The Dark Knight — but he doesn't do it alone. At one point, the Joker's henchman has a bomb inside him that the Joker activates with his cell phone.  The ensuing explosion allows the Joker to escape.  If that henchman had just been killed, no Joker escape, no ensuing chaos in Gotham. Likewise, in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, Bane would have been stymied without that dude who gets Bruce Wayne's fingerprints from Selina Kyle.</p>

<h4>2) The Kazon Takeover in <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em>, &quot;Basics&quot;</h4>
<p>A Random Kazon gets picked up by <em>Voyager</em> dying in an escape pod.  But the evil Seska has had his body chemistry altered, and he explodes in the brig, rupturing a plasma conduit and knocking out <em>Voyager</em>'s defenses, allowing it to be taken by the Kazon and Seska.  If he'd just been left to die, none of that would have happened. Along similar lines, in <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>'s &quot;Reunion,&quot; Duras' aide in TNG's &quot;Reunion&quot; who likewise has a bomb implanted in him.  The bomb goes off during an argument about the Klingon Right of Succession, and throws the whole succession of the Klingon Empire into chaos.  </p>

<h4>3) Massive Time-Traveling Art Fraud in Doctor Who, &quot;City of Death&quot;</h4>
<p>When you watch &quot;City of Death&quot; for the 500th time (not that we're speaking from personal experience or anything) you start to notice just how indispensible Hermann is, despite mostly sticking to the background. He's the butler whom the Doctor loves because &quot;he's so violent,&quot; and he plays a key role in stealing the Mona Lisa, along with the Countess. No Hermann, no discreet sales of Gutenberg Bibles. And no intimidated Russian physicist in the basement.</p>

<h4>4) A Major Coup in the <em>G.I. Joe</em> Movies</h4>
<p>In the first <em>G.I. Joe</em> movie, Zartan's an expert in make-up and disguise, who's just one of Destro's aides. He helps the Baroness and Storm Shadow acquire nanotech warheads.  And if he'd died around this point, he'd just be a henchman who was killed.  But instead he survives, the nanotech is used to alter his appearance, and he takes the place of the President, leading directly to the events of the second movie.</p>

<h4>5) Finding the Key, in <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> Season 5</h4>
<p>Jinx is like the archetypal minion — fawning, slightly incompetent, and constantly being browbeaten by his boss, the goddess Glory. And yet, Jinx is the one who seems to get stuff done around here. And Jinx is the one who finds out that Dawn is the Key, when Glory is totally stymied. If our heroes had just wiped out Jinx the first time they saw him, Dawn might have been safe a lot longer.</p>

<h4>6) Bringing Back Voldemort in the <em>Harry Potter</em> books</h4>
<p>Voldemort's return relies on at least a couple of hench-peeps, who could have been wiped off the map easily, bringing the whole thing to a finish early. Like Quirinus Quirrell in <em>The Philosopher's Stone</em>: We know Snape has suspected Professor Quirrell was up to no good for a lot of the book.  Sometime before Halloween, at least, since he recognizes the troll attack that night as a distraction.  And if Snape had killed him or even just turned him in (seriously, this is a world with truth potions.  Potions that Snape has), the whole rest of the book, and Voldemort's plan never would have happened. And you could also say the same thing for Peter Pettigrew in <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>.  Yes, thematically, Harry not killing him is supposed to be all about how important mercy is, but Pettigrew is super important to the Voldemort's second rise.  He is, after all, the one who chops his hand off in the ceremony that brings Voldemort back.</p>

<h4>7) Luring Bob Into a Trap, in <em>The Incredibles</em></h4>
<p>The supervillain Syndrome might be a former wannabe sidekick — but he wouldn't have gotten far without his own helper, Mirage. It's Mirage who lures Bob to come to the island and deal with the giant robot, thus setting in motion Syndrome's plan to take care of his former idol. And Bob ought to have suspected that someone named &quot;Mirage&quot; was not going to be what she seemed, right?</p>

<h4>8) Starting a War in X-Men: First Class</h4>
<p>Shaw's whole &quot;end the human race with a nuclear holocaust&quot; plan is sheer elegance in its simplicity — but it requires pretty heavily on Azazel, the teleporting mutant with the awesome fashion sense. He's the one who teleports Colonel Hendry to the War Room from Vegas at the start of the film. Otherwise, Hendry couldn't have advocated putting missiles in Turkey, and Shaw would still be sitting around in his awesome strip club making fancy helmets. Also, in Grant Morrison's <em>New X-Men</em> comics, Magneto would be totally screwed without Esme, one of the cuckoos, sneaking him his supply of Kick and keeping Magneto's powers going. </p>

<h4>9) Launching the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion in Star Wars EU</h4>
<p>This one's kind of a subversion.  Everyone thinks Onimi is just a weak pet of the Supreme Overlord. Instead, it turns out that he's actually the force behind the Yuuzhan Vong.  If only he'd been killed earlier, the war would have ended before it began. And if ships could be henchmen, then consider the Suprosa in <em>Return of the Jedi</em> — that's the the freighter that the Bothans and the Alliance intercepted to get at the information it was carrying.  Ultimately, that information turns out to be the false information about the second Death Star that Emperor Palpatine has hinged his whole plan to eliminate the Alliance on.  If, when the Rebels found that the freighter was far better armed than they suspected, they'd just blown it up, the whole Battle of Endor never would have happened.</p>

<h4>10) Almost Every Villain Scheme in the James Bond Movies</h4>
<p>In <em>Goldfinger</em>, James Bond has a lot of fun seducing Pussy Galore and turning her to his side — but he could have just killed her. Goldfinger's plan to rob Fort Knox depends on Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying toxic gas everywhere.  No Pussy Galore, no Pussy Galore's Flying Circus, no Fort Knox break in. In <em>Thunderball</em>, Angelo is a SPECTRE henchman whose appearance gets altered to match that of a NATO pilot.  He kills the NATO pilot and takes his place, so SPECTRE can steal the atomic bombs on his plane.  If only Angelo had been killed earlier, the whole plan is off. And then there are <a href="http://io9.com/5077509/the-most-ludicrous-james-bond-supervillain-plots-of-all-time">the women who have been brainwashed to love chickens</a><inset id="5077509"></inset> in <em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</em>: they're the key to Blofeld's scheme to  unleash biological warfare. Bond finds out about this, and doesn't try to capture them, kill them, rescue them, or anything else. Instead, he focuses on getting Blofeld out of Switzerland, so he can be arrested — and he fails, so Blofeld can use the women to blackmail the world. And in <em>Tomorrow Never Dies</em>, if Bond had just killed Henry Gupta the moment he saw him, he never would have gotten the GPS encoder to Carver, and that's the end of Carver's plan right there. And finally, the whole plot of Skyfall happens because Eve misses her shot to take out Patrice at the start of the movie — if Patrice dies, he doesn't deliver the list of undercover agents to Silva, M doesn't get pressured to resign and then nearly blown up by Silva, and so on.</p>

<p>Set in the not-too-distant future, the story unfolds as project personnel talk about the mission and their various roles within it. But just as things start to get rolling, the team is confronted with something far more profound. </p>
<p>Dulull is a London-based visual effects veteran who started his career developing video game cinematics. He's done visual effects for such films as <em>The Dark Knight</em>, <em>Prince Of Persia</em>, and <em>The Chronicles Of Narnia</em>. He also directed <em>Fubar</em> a film about a battlefield in which the people are replaced by cats and dogs, and later released <a href="http://www.fubar-movie.com/" target="_blank"><em>Fubar Redux</em></a> thanks to a successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/littleredrobot/fubar-extended-redux-edition" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Since the film was released last week, it has lead Dulull to getting signed for representation as a director in Hollywood and currently developing the feature film version.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"short films";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"project kronos";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"space exploration";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"interstellar space travel";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:0:"";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 10 May 2013 16:40:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"499595618";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"George Dvorsky";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:16:{s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=utf-8";s:3:"p3p";s:48:"CP=IDC DSP COR CURa ADMa OUR IND PHY ONL COM STA";s:14:"cteonnt-length";s:6:"130960";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"48418";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sat, 11 May 2013 11:29:20 GMT";s:3:"via";s:11:"1.1 varnish";s:3:"age";s:1:"0";s:10:"connection";s:10:"keep-alive";s:11:"x-served-by";s:13:"cache-a15-AMS";s:7:"x-cache";s:4:"MISS";s:12:"x-cache-hits";s:1:"0";s:7:"x-timer";s:31:"S1368271759.586782455,VS0,VE514";s:13:"cache-control";s:28:"private; no-store; max-age=0";s:10:"x-cdn-view";s:14:"mantle-default";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20121030175911";}
